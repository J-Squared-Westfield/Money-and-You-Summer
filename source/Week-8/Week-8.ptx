            <title>Employer-Sponsored Retirement</title>
            <p>
                Due to the societal shift away from family homesteads to areas of industry, there grew a demand for financial security after a life in the work force.
                In order to attract the best workers, employers began offering benefits that help their employees save for retirement.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are essentially two flavors of employer-sponsored retirement plans.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <alert>defined benefit plan</alert> is a plan in which the employer makes a guarantee to pay a well-defined amount to an employee after they retire.
                The most common form of a defined benefit plan is a <alert>pension</alert> in which an employer makes a promise to make regular (usually monthly) payments to a retired employee until their death or a certain amount of time after retirement.
                We’ll discuss these more in the next section.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because defined benefit plans put the burden of funding retirement completely on the employer, many employers have shifted to a <alert>defined contribution plan</alert> for their employees.
                Under these plans, employers put a defined amount of money into an account on your behalf.
                When you retire, you have access to the funds in this account.
                The idea is that these funds are invested and will grow long-term into a sizeable amount.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are benefits and drawbacks to each plan type.
                Form the worker’s viewpoint, defined benefit plans offer the best security as retirement is up to their employer.
                However, workers can feel “trapped” in their jobs as they will lose much of the benefits of their plan if they change careers.
                Defined contribution plans allow for more freedom in employment as retirement accounts are usually transferrable.
                Form an employer point of view, defined contribution plans are preferred as there are no long-term commitments that they must honor.
            </p>

            <p>
                These days, most employer-sponsored plans are defined-contribution plans.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-401k-403b">
            <title>401(k)'s and 403(b)'s</title>
            <p>
                Taxation is a little tricky with regards to savings.
                The philosophy is, if you put money aside to use way into the future, is it really income? Because of this question, most retirement plans come in the form of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                In most ways, 401(k)’s and 403(b)’s are the same.
                The biggest difference is that for-profit companies generally sponsor 401(k) plans, and non-profit institutions generally offer 403(b) plans.
                These plans must be sponsored by an employer (you can’t just open your own).
            </p>

            <p>
                Under one of these plans, you have the option of deducting some of your pay to be deposited into your personal plan account.
                Many employers will also contribute funds as a “matching,” up to a certain percentage of your income.
                For example, if your employer offers 5%matching, for every dollar you deduct into your account, up to 5%of your annual pay, your employer will also contribute a dollar.
                If you deduct more than 5%of your total pay, your employer will not contribute any more.
                For example, suppose you earn $100,000 and your employer matches 7%for your retirement plan.
                If you deduct 4%of your pay in a year ($4,000), your employer would match that, making your total amount put into your account $8,000.
                If you deduct 7%($7,000), your employer would match that, making your total amount put into the account $14,000.
                If you deduct 10%of your pay ($10,000), your employer would still only contribute 7%($7,000).
                So, the total deduction would be $17,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>In general, employer matching is considered part of your total compensation. You should always try to maximize employer contributions. Otherwise, you are not making the most you could from your job.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, the most you can contribute each year in a 401(k) or 403(b) is $23,500.
                If you’re over 50, you can contribute $31,000.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Taxation-and-Roth-Accounts">
            <title>Taxation and Roth Accounts</title>
            <p>
                There are two ways to enjoy the tax benefits of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.
                It depends on whether your account is a “traditional” or a “Roth” account.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a traditional retirement account, any contributions you make reduce your taxable income for the year.
                For example, suppose you make $100,000 (pre-tax) and contribute $10,000 to your 401(k).
                Then only $90,000 of your pay is taxed.
                The downside to this is that when you retire and begin withdrawing money from your 401(k), that money is then taxed as regular income.
                So, if your 401(k)/403(b) is your main source of retirement income, you will need more saved up with a traditional account because of taxes you’ll pay when you withdraw money.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a Roth retirement account, any contributions you make are made after you pay taxes on your pay.
                So, if you make $100,000 (pre-tax) and contribute $10,000 to your 401(k), you will still be taxed on your full $100,000.
                However, when you make withdrawals from your account when you retire, that income is completely untaxed.
                Generally, you need to save a bit less with Roth accounts because of the lack of taxation with withdrawals.
            </p>

            <p>
                You often have a choice of a traditional or Roth account.
                The choice depends on a number of factors.
                People with higher incomes often select traditional accounts to reduce their tax burden each year.
                People who start a 401(k)/403(b) later in life also tend toward traditional accounts as they will earn less in investment income.
                People who start accounts earlier in life often choose Roth accounts as they will earn more in investment income but can avoid taxes on it.

    <section xml:id="sec-IRAs">
        <title>IRA's</title>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-IRA">
            <title>IRA</title>
            <p>
                An <alert>individual retirement plan</alert> is essentially a self-sponsored 401(k).
                An IRA is an account you open yourself and fund yourself.
                IRA’s are meant to act as methods to supplement retirement incomes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Practically, IRA’s function a lot like employer-sponsored plans.
                You can contribute up to a certain amount (currently $7,000 per year).
                You can have either a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your taxation preferences.
            </p>

            <p>
                One common misconception is that you cannot have both a 401(k) and an IRA.
                You absolutely can! And you should!
            </p>

            <p>
                The main difference with an IRA and employer-sponsored accounts is when you see the tax benefits in a traditional account.
                In a traditional IRA, you still deposit money into an account after taxes are paid from your paycheck, making it feel like a Roth account.
                However, when you file taxes, you can then deduct the amount you contributed from your taxable income, which will increase your tax refund (or reduce your taxes owed).

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Beauty-of-Pensions">
            <title>The Beauty of Pensions</title>
            <p>
                When employers first began offering retirement incentives to employees, most offered defined-benefit plans in the form of pensions.
                Under a pension, employees have a portion of their pay deducted from their checks over their entire career.
                The employers use these deductions to invest in various markets.
                When an employee retires, the employer is obligated to pay a pre-determined amount to the employee until their death.
                </p>

            <p>
                Pensions come in all sorts of flavors.
                Some even come with guaranteed healthcare for life.
                Some will continue to make payments to surviving spouses after the employee’s death.
                How much an employee gets usually depends on how long they worked for the employer and how much they made.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, pensions are expensive.
                And due to huge increases in life expectancies, many pensions are under-funded and cannot fully live up to the promises made.
                Thus, pensions are becoming increasingly rare.
                Massachusetts still has a state-sponsored pension system.
                It is completely funded by state employees (non-state employees don’t pay a penny in funding it).
                It is decently well-funded.
                Currently, the pension offers a maximum payment amount equal to 80%of the average of your five highest-paid years of salary, which is one of the highest available in the world of pensions.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing to keep in mind with pensions is that all payments are taxable.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest downside of pensions is that there is no account that can be transferred to another employer (unless it is in the same system, such as moving from one state job to another state job).
                In this sense, employees can become “trapped” in a job because they do not want to give up what they’ve put into a pension.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Vesting">
            <title>Vesting</title>
            Generally, pension plans come with a “vesting period.” In order to be eligible for pension payments, workers have to work for a minimum number of years.
            Once they reach that minimum number, they are “vested” in the pension.
            Being vested means that you are legally entitled to pension payments, according to the underlying agreements.
            For example, in the Massachusetts state pension system, there is a vesting period of 10 years.
            Often, once you are vested, you can leave the job and still receive some kind of payment when you retire (usually much reduced).
            If you leave a job before you are vested, you will have whatever you contributed to the plan returned to you, and you will not be entitled to any pension payments when you retire.
