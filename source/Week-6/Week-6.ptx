            <p>
                Consider the following.
                You have the opportunity to play a game.
                It costs $100 to play.
                If you win, you will get $10,000.
                If you lose, you get nothing and lose your $100.
                Will you play the game?
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of you may have said “no” right away.
                Some of you may have responded “yes” right away.
                For most, their answer will depend on information I haven’t given.
                In particular, the chance of winning will likely affect whether or not you’ll play the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose I told you there is a 99%of winning the game.
                Given the large prize amount, many people would chose to play the game.
                Suppose I said there was a one in a million chance of winning.
                Many people would chose not to play the game.
                Notice an important observation.
                There is a <em>risk</em> of losing $100, and your willingness to risk that $100 depends on the chance on being <em>rewarded</em> with winnings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s flip things around a little bit.
                Suppose you have the same game that costs $100 to play.
                Also suppose that you know the chances of winning the game is 25%(one in four).
                If the amount you could win was $200, would you play? What if the amount you could win was $10,000? You are probably much more willing to play with the higher possible winnings amount.
                Again, based on the risk, you want a certain amount of potential <em>reward</em> for taking on that risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most important concepts in finance is the notion of risk and reward.
                <em>Risk</em> refers to the possibility that you will lose some or all of the money you invest.
                <em>Reward</em> refers to the concept of <em>potentially</em> earning money for taking on risk.
                That is, the riskier an investment opportunity is, the higher the reward you would expect for taking on the risk.
                Conversely, the higher the reward for an investment, the more underlying risk will be involved.
                This concept is known as <em>risk vs.
                reward</em>.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Risk-Tolerance">
            <title>Risk Tolerance</title>
            <p>
                Every investment opportunity comes with a level of risk.
                However, how much risk someone is willing to take on varies greatly from person to person.
                Someone who is more inclined to take on riskier activities is called <em>risk tolerant</em>.
                Someone who is less inclined to take on riskier activities is called <em>risk averse</em>.
                Risk tolerance heavily tied to some of the common money biases.
                For example, people with higher loss aversion bias tend to be more risk averse.
            </p>

            <p>
                In general, there is no “good” or “bad” level of risk tolerance, with the exception of extreme risk tolerance or aversion.
                Someone with extremely high levels of risk tolerance has a greater chance of taking big losses eventually.
                Someone with extremely low levels of risk tolerance will miss out on opportunities to accumulate wealth.
                However, the majority of people lie in between these two extremes.

                            In order to get your money back on deposits, if you want to cancel, you have to do so now.

                It is very difficult to classify someone into a category or risk-tolerance level.
                Risk tolerance is a spectrum, and that spectrum also depends on various facets of like.
                A sky-diving instructor may be fairly risk-averse when it comes to money.
                Someone who is very risk averse when it comes to physical activities may be a thrill-seeker when it comes to money.
                So, instead of tallying up points to put you into a category, instead you should look at your answers and think about what they may say about your tendencies to money.
            </p>

            <p>
                For each question, the answers go from most risk averse to most risk tolerant.
                That is, (a) is the most risk-averse option, and the later letters are more risk tolerant.
                <alert>Write a short paragraph reflecting on your answers and what they may indicated regarding your risk tolerance.
                Would your answers indicate that you are more risk tolerant or more risk averse? Why?</alert>

            <title>Saving vs. Investing</title>
            <p>
                Strictly speaking, <em>savings</em> would be money that you set aside to be used for later.
                Keeping money in a jar or under your bed would be a form of savings.
                Putting money into a savings account is also usually considered savings.
                <em>Investing</em> is slightly different.
                When you invest in something, you use your money to buy or hold rights to some “asset.” Common examples include stocks, bonds, real estate, option, etc.
                The hope is that the value of those assets will increase over time, and when you sell the asset, you will earn a decent profit.
            </p>

            <p>
                To better understand the difference between savings and investments, we need to explore a few terms of financial tools (“instruments”).
            </p>

            <p>
                Risk: As we’ve explored earlier, the <alert>risk</alert> of a financial instrument is the relative likelihood that you lose some or all of your money.
                Generally, savings are less risky than investments.
            </p>

            <p>
                Return: The <alert>return</alert> on an investment is how much you earn or lose.
                Notice that return can be positive or negative.
                In general, financial instruments with higher risk should come with larger return opportunities.
                Generally, investments <em>expect</em> a higher return than savings.
                (Note that returns are not guaranteed!)
            </p>

            <p>
                Liquidity: The <alert>liquidity</alert> of an asset is a measurement of how easy it is to sell the object for cash.
                Cash, of course, is very “liquid.” A large office building would be much less liquid.
                Because of the difficulty to sell them, more non-liquid investments tend to come with higher expected returns than liquid ones.
                Liquid objects can be either savings or investments.
                Non-liquid assets tend to be investments.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Savings-Opportunities">
            <title>Savings Opportunities</title>
            <p>
                Let’s consider a few common savings opportunities:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Savings Accounts - These are accounts in which you deposit your money.
                            In a sense, you loan your money to the bank that they use for their primary business purposes.
                            In return, you earn a small amount of interest each month.
                            Savings accounts are considered low-risk, low-reward options.
                            You generally can withdraw your money fairly easily, making them quite liquid.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Certificates of Deposit (CDs) - CD’s are essentially savings accounts with the added rule that once you deposit your money, you cannot withdraw it for a pre-specified amount of time (usually 6 months to 2 years).
                            It is usually still possible to withdraw your money before the allowed date, but it comes with a reduction in your interest earnings.
                            Because you take on more personal risk by guaranteeing the bank access to your money for a longer period of time, CDs come with higher interest rates than basic savings accounts.
                            CDs are still considered low-risk, low-reward opportunities.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) - An HSA is account in which you can deposit money to use for medical expenses in the future.
                            While HSAs generally earn interest, it is quite low.
                            Their main benefit is that any money you deposit into HSA reduce your taxable income.
                            (However, if you withdraw it for other reasons, you will incur a penalty.) These are low-risk, low-reward opportunities.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                Next, we’ll look at common investments:
            </p>

            <p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Bonds - A <alert>bond</alert> is a loan you make to a business or government.
                            If you hold a bond, you will be entitled to a pre-specified payment at some future date (called the “maturity date.”) When the payment date comes, the bond “matures.” Bonds can have a variety of payment dates from months into the future to decades.
                            Usually, bonds with longer maturity dates will offer a greater return.
                            Some bonds pay interest payments (called “coupons”).
                            Depending on the business or government, the risk of a bond will differ.
                            Agencies with a long history of repaying bonds are less risky and offer lower returns.
                            Agencies with less of a proven history of repaying debts need to offer higher returns.
                            While you technically cannot get your money from a bond before its maturity date, you can sell your rights to the bond on a financial market.
                            Bonds can have a low-to-moderate amount of risk, depending on the agency and time frame (and a low-to-moderate return).
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Stocks - A <alert>stock</alert>, loosely speaking, is a representation of partial ownership of a company.
                            How much a stock is valued depends a number of things.
                            Some stocks pay “dividends,” which is a small share of profits the company earned.
                            The value of the company’s assets influence the stock’s price.
                            There is also a most squishy concept in that the value of a stock can change due to how much others are willing to pay for a stock.
                            Stock values can change greatly day-to-day.
                            A fire in a company’s headquarters can tank a stock’s value.
                            A positive end-of-year earnings report can make a stock’s price soar.
                            So, there is a great deal of risk with buying and selling stocks.
                            They are high-risk, high-reward assets.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Mutual Fund - In general, it is advised to invest in a bunch of different stocks rather than just one (“diversification”).
                            The idea is that, even if one company that you’ve invested in loses a lot of value, the others you’ve invested in can help cushion that blow.
                            Some financial institutions offer <alert>mutual funds</alert> that can help with this.
                            When you invest in a mutual fund, you are contributing money to a large pool that is used to buy a large number of different stocks.
                            Mutual funds can be for stocks in a particular sector (like technology or oil production) or can be for an entire market.
                            Mutual funds will come with some kind of fee structure for the service provided in management of the mutual fund.
                            An <alert>index fund</alert> is a type of mutual fund with a more passive approach to selecting stocks, but they come with lower fees.
                            Mutual funds are considered moderate-risk, moderate reward assets.

                            Commodities and Options - A “commodity” is a tangible asset like gold, oil, or rice.
                            You can theoretically buy and sell these commodities on a market.
                            More realistically, investors purchase “options.” An <alert>option</alert> is a <em>right</em> to buy or sell a commodity to someone at a moment in time.
                            Usually, the commodity isn’t actually traded, making options essentially a gamble based on how you predict a commodity’s value to change over time.
                            You can also purchase options on stocks.
                            Consider an example.
                            Stock XYZ currently has a value of $100.
                            You think the stock’s value will increase, but you do not want to buy the stock.
                            You can purchase the option to buy the stock later at a particular price.
                            (The option price will depend on a variety of factors.) Suppose you pay $10 for the option to buy the stock for $100 in a month.
                            If in one month, the stock’s value is $150, you will essentially get $40.
                            (A $150 stock for $100 minus the $10 option fee.) If the stock’s value instead drops to $50, you do not buy the stock, and you lose that $10.
                            Options are considered high-risk, high-reward assets.
                            They are recommended only for experience investors.

                        We have discussed a number of different savings and investment opportunities out there.  
                        However, there are many more.  
                        Do a bit of research.  
                        Find one type of savings opportunity that is available that we haven't discussed (in class or in the reading) and find one investment opportunity that is available that we haven't discussed.
                        For both, briefly describe how those savings/opportunity opportunities work.
