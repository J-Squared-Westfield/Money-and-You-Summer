    <title>Unit 5: Debt and Debt Management</title>
    <p>
        In our previous unit, we considered some components of the loan world.
        Your credit is invaluable tool in applying for loans, and credit cards are a particular kind of loan.
        In this unit, we’ll focus on the properties of loans in general.
        We will also look at the nature of debt and techniques for getting out of debt.

        <title>Properties of Loans</title>
       <p>
            Most of us will need to take out loans throughout our lives.
            Car loans, mortgages, student loans, etc.
            are all extremely common and make up a huge part of the American and global economies.
            However, not all loans are created equal.
            Understanding the components or <alert>terms</alert> of loans can help you save a lot of money in the long run.
        </p>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Principal">
            <title>Principal</title>
            <p>
                When you borrow money, the amount that you borrow is called the <alert>principal.</alert> It is the base amount that you need to pay back.
                As you repay your loan over time, some of your payments will go toward what you owe (the principal) and reduce that amount.
                Once you pay back the entire principal amount, you have repaid the loan.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Balance">
            <title>Balance</title>
            <p>
                At any moment in time, the amount you owe on a loan is your <alert>balance</alert>.
                As you make payments on your loan, the balance of your loan (usually) decreases.
                Once your balance has reached $0, you will have paid off your loan and don’t owe any more payments.
                For example, suppose you take out a loan of $1,000.
                The principal on your loan is $1,000, and that is your balance.
                Suppose that your first payment is $250 where $200 “goes toward the principal” and $50 is interest/fees.
                Then after the payment, your balance drops to $800.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an important thing about balances.
                Your balance will increase if you don’t make payments.
                This is because of interest.
                Take the last scenario where you had $50 in interest.
                If you didn’t make that $250 payment, your balance would have increase to $1,050 (the $1,000 previous balance plus the $50 in interest).
                As we’ll discuss next, higher balances means even more that you’ll pay in interest.
            </p>

        </subsection>    

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Term">
            <title>Term</title>
            <p>
                The <alert>term</alert> of your loan is the length or amount of time it will take to pay off the loan.
                For installment loans, like car loans and mortgages, the term is agreed upon at the start of the loan.
                For example, mortgages generally have terms of 10, 15 or 30 years.
                Car loans typically have terms of 4 to 7 years.
                Payday loans typically have terms of a few weeks or a month.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Collateral">
            <title>Collateral</title>
            <p>
                When a bank loans you money, they are taking on the risk of you not paying them back.
                Sometimes, a loan will require something of great value that you agree you would give up if you cannot pay back your loan.
                This item of great value is called “collateral.” Some loans naturally have collateral.
                With a mortgage, the house is the collateral.
                For car loans, the car is collateral.
                With smaller, personal loans, it is sometimes the case that you need to choose an item of value (e.g.
                car, jewelry, etc.) to place as collateral.
                Loans with collateral agreements tend to require less in interest payments due to the decrease in risk of not getting paid back.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Interest">
            <title>Interest</title>
            <p>
                Most loans are not free.
                Imagine you are a bank, and someone asks for $1,000 with a promise to pay it back.
                Why would you give them that loan? If they only paid back $1,000 and nothing else, that is simply bad business for your bank.
                Instead of loaning that $1,000, you could have used it to invest it.
                Further, there is a risk that the person won’t pay back that $1,000.
                So, as compensation for both losing the opportunity to invest that $1,000 and taking on the risk of not getting the money back, you want to charge the borrow extra money.
                This extra money is <alert>interest</alert>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interest is what makes loans possible.
                By giving out a loan with interest, the loan is a kind of investment.
                By taking on the risk of lending money, the bank expects investment compensation via interest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interest is one of the most important, and most complex, terms of a loan.
                How large interest payments are and how they’re calculated can heavily impact how much someone can borrow and how well they’ll be able to pay off the loan.
                We discuss this next.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Fees">
            <title>Fees</title>
            <p>
                Some loans cost money to actually process and start.
                For example, taking out a loan for a mortgage requires work to transfer the deed to you.
                It requires a title office and a lawyer, among other things.
                These fees are generally paid by the person taking out the loan.
                This can happen in two ways.
                In one way, the loanee pays all the fees up front when the loan begins.
                However, since most people don’t have the needed money to pay fees up front, fee costs are paid in small increments as the loanee pays back the loan.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-APR">
            <title>APR</title>
            <p>
                For the vast majority of loans, interest is calculated based on the <alert>APR</alert> or <alert>annual percentage rate</alert>.
                For simplicity, let’s assume that loan payments are made once a year.
                Suppose you have a loan balance of $10,000.
                If your APR is 6%, then the amount of interest you need to pay at the end of the year is <m>10,000 \times 0.06 = \$600</m>.
                Now, if your APR was 15% instead, then the amount of interest you need to pay at the end of the year is <m>10,000\times 0.15 = \$1,500</m>.
                As you can see, when you take out a loan, you generally want the lowest APR possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                What your APR will be is determine by a few factors.
                The type of loan (mortgage, car, payday, etc.) is a big factor.
                Below are some ranges of current APR’s for types of loans:

            <p>
                You’ll notice vastly different rates for different types of loans.
                As we’ll explore later, there are reasons behind these differences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your credit is also a major determinant of your APR.
                Because interest payments are compensation for the risk of lending you money and your credit is a measurement of how likely you are to pay back money, it makes sense that those with higher credit would need to pay less in interest (lower APR).
                Those with lower credit would need higher APR’s.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other factors of APR’s include the length or term of your loan and whether there is any collateral.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is one little fib I made about APR.
                Technically, APR doesn’t count just interest.
                It also includes fees on the loan.
                You may see loans rates advertised with two percentages: the “rate” and the APR.
                The loan rate is what is used to calculate just interest.
                The APR is used to calculate interest and fees combined.
                Effectively, the APR can be used to calculate your actual loan payments.

    <section xml:id="sec-How-Interest-Compounds">
        <title>How Interest Compounds</title>
        <p>
            Just as a trigger warning, there will be some math in this section.
            You do not need to worry about formulas are the direct calculations.
            What you need to take away is <em>the power of compound interest.</em>
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Compounding">
            <title>Compounding</title>
            <p>
                Most loans have what is called <alert>compound interest</alert>.
                Rather than defining it, let’s look at an example.
                Suppose you take out a loan of $10,000 with an APR of 12%.
                After a year, the amount of interest owed is <m>10,000 \times 0.12 = \$1,200</m>.
                Now, suppose you don’t make any payments.
                Then the balance of your loan becomes <m>10,000 + 1,200 = \$11,200</m>.
                When interest “compounds,” we mean that further interest owe is calculated not just on the principal, but previous interest amounts.
                So, after the second year, the amount of interest accumulated would be <m>11,200\times 0.12 = \$1,344</m>.
                Notice that this is quite a bit higher than the first year’s interest.
                Again, if you don’t make a payment, the balance would become <m>11,200 + 1,344 = \$12,544</m>.
                The third year’s interest would be <m>12,544\times 0.12 = \$1,505.28</m>.
                It just keeps going and going.
            </p>

            <p>
                What is vital to understand is that, because interest compounds, it can be very easy for loan balances to get out of control.
                The higher the APR, the easier it is to fall into unmanageable debt.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Conversion-Periods">
            <title>Conversion Periods and Effective APR</title>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, APR is not quite as simple as we’ve been using it.
                This is because of what is called “conversion periods” or “compounding periods.” In our prior calculations, we have been imagining that interest payments are calculated at the end of each year.
                In reality, most interest payment amounts are calculated each month or each day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is how it works.
                Suppose that you take out a car loan for $20,000 that offers a 12% APR that is “compounded monthly.” Since there are 12 months in a years, the amount of interest charged in a month is <m>\frac{12\%}{12}= 1\%</m>.
                So, after one month, you owe <m>20,000 \times 0.01 = \$200</m> in interest.
                If you don’t make a payment, your balance is $20,200.
                Your next interest amount owed after the next month is then <m>20,200 \times 0.01 = \$202</m>.
                If you made no payments for a year, you would actually have total interest accumulated as $2,536.
                Notice that this is not 12% of $20,000.
                It is actually 12.68% of $20,000.
                This 12.68% rate is sometimes called the “effective APR.”
            </p>

            <p>
                If in the example above, interest were compounded every day, the total interest owed at the end of one year would be $2,550, which is even more.
                It is about 12.74% of the $20,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                What to take away from this is that not all APR’s are equal.
                A 5% APR that is compounded monthly accumulates less interest than a 5%APR compounded daily.
                It is something to keep in mind.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Activity-Why-APR-Matters">
            <title>Activity: Why APR Matters</title>
            <p>
                For this activity, you will look at how APR and loan length can affect how much you actually pay on loans.
                You will look at two common loan types.
                First, open up this calculator: <url href="https://www.calculator.net/payment-calculator.html">https://www.calculator.net/payment-calculator.html</url>

                        <p>
                            Suppose you would like to borrow $250,000 to purchase a home, which is a very reasonable amount.
                            <ol>
                                <li>

                                        Suppose you have a 15-year term.
                                        Currently, possible APR’s for a 15-year mortgage are about 6.1%to 8.0%.
                                        For each of the following APR’s: 6.1%, 7.2%and 8.0%, use the calculator to find what your monthly payments will be and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.

        <title>How to Get a Loan</title>
        <p>
            Ultimately, to get a loan, you need to apply for one.  
            There are a number of factors that will determine if you will be approved for a loan and the loan terms.
        </p>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Credit-loans">
            <title>Credit</title>
            <p>
                The better credit you have, the more likely you are to be approved for a loan and the better terms you’ll get on a loan.  
                Recall that your credit rating is determined by the following:
            </p>

            <p>
                -Payment history.  Lenders want to see a long history of your bill payments being made on time.
            </p>
            <p>
               -Current loan balances.  Lenders prefer to see that you have not borrowed too much money and like to see smaller loan balances. 
            </p>
            <p>
                -Credit age.  Lenders like to see a lot of history with lines of credit.  The longer you have been managing money well, the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                -Credit mix.  Lenders like to see a diverse history of finances.  A broader range of types of loans and bills in your recent history, the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                -Credit inquiries.  Frequently applying for loans is a red flag to lenders.  Try to only apply for lines of credit only when you need it.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Debt-to-Income-Ratio">
            <title>Debt-to-Income Ratio</title>
            <p>
                Lenders want to make sure that you’ll be able to pay back any loan you take out.
                The biggest factor in being able to pay back a loan is simply being able to afford the loan payments in your budget.
                One way lenders measure this ability is to look at your <alert>debt-to-income ratio</alert>.
                Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is calculated as the total amount you pay on your debts each month divided by your monthly <alert>gross</alert> income (before taxes).
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that your DTI is based on your gross (before taxes) income.
                This can be confusing, considering that most personal budgets are based on take-home (after taxes) income.
                For example, if your gross monthly income is $4,000, taxes are $1,000, and you pay $1,500 on debts each month.
                Then you have $3,000 for your monthly budget, and your DTI is<m>/frac{1,500}{4,000} = 0.375</m> or 37.5%  A rough rule of thumb is that lenders prefer to see a debt-to-income ratio under 36%, <alert>>including the loan for which you are applying</alert>.
                For example, suppose your gross monthly pay is $2,000 and that you already pay $300 on student loans and $320 on a car loan each month.
                Then your current DTI is<m>\frac{300+320}{2,000} = 0.31</m> or 31%.
                Suppose you want a credit card.
                The credit card company will look at how much debt you can handle.
If a “safe’’ DTI is 36
                While the credit card bank may not reject your credit card application in this scenario, it is unlikely that they’ll give you a high credit limit.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Employment-History">
            <title>Employment History</title>
            <p>
                For some loans, particularly long-term loans like car loan and mortgages, it is not just your current income that matters but your employment history.
                Jobs can come and go; lenders know this.
                Suppose you just landed a great, high-paying job a week ago that will allow you to afford a new car and a house.
                Lenders are unlikely to approve of these loans for a while.
                The reason is that one of the biggest reasons people lose their jobs is that they simply don’t work out.
                Maybe your new job turns out to be toxic for you.
                Maybe they don’t find your work satisfactory or you don’t survive a probationary period.
                Maybe the position itself was unstable.
                In general, people who have been in a position for a while are more likely to stay employed.
                So, lenders want to see stability in your employment history.
                Even after landing a great new job, you may have to wait a few months before taking out a loan.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Other-Factors">
            <title>Other Factors</title>
            <p>
                As discussed earlier, collateral can act as a way to reduce the risk of lending you money.
                For some loans, you can put up something as collateral to make the bank more comfortable with loaning you money.
                For some loans, collateral is part of the loan.
                Your house is collateral for a mortgage.
                Your car is collateral for a car loan.
                Your house is collateral for a home-equity loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of the loan will also play a factor.
                For some kinds of loans, the purpose is clear: mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc.
                For others, you may need to describe the purpose of the loan, and the bank will take that into consideration.
                Purposes for which the bank could more reliably get their money back in case of emergencies will be seen more favorably.
                For example, applying for a home equity loan to upgrade your kitchen is seen as less risky; your house will be used as collateral, and the lent money for the kitchen will increase its value.
                On the other hand, borrowing money to buy a bunch of crypto currency would be seen as incredibly risk since the bank wouldn’t be able to recover much of its money if the crypto you buy tanks.

        <title>Predatory-Lending</title>
        <p>
            There are some people out there that don’t miss a chance to take advantage of someone in a rough position.
            In the world of loans, some people try to sweep people in <alert>predatory loans</alert>.
            Predatory loans are loans made to people with little regard to their financial health.
            Most predatory loans come with extremely high APR’s and can quickly trap people in a cycle of debt.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Targets">
            <title>Targets</title>
            <p>
                Most predatory lenders target one of two kinds of people.
                The first are people in a tough financial position.
                For example, if someone comes back to their apartment from work to find an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent, but their next paycheck won’t come for a while, that person may be desperate enough to take out a high-interest loan to pay that late rate.
                Pay-day lenders, among others, target people in tough financial positions like this.
                The second targets are people with lower financial literacy and knowledge of loans.
                In particular, lenders may try to target people with higher present bias than others, advertising quick access to large amounts of cash while hiding the high APR in the background.
                This lending tactic is extremely common, and even the biggest banks look for these targets.
                (If you have a credit card, I guarantee that the company occasionally tries to advertise cash-advance loans to you.
                Don’t.)
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Examples">
            <title>Examples</title>

            <p>
                <alert>-Pay-day Loans</alert>
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the example above in which someone needs cash now to pay rent to avoid eviction but pay-day isn’t for a while.
                Pay-day lenders capitalize on this exact kind of scenario.
                When you take out a pay-day loan, you borrow a bit less than the amount in one of your paychecks and promise to give your next paycheck or two to the lender.
                For example, if your paychecks are usually about $1,000, you might borrow $900 from the pay-day lender with the promise to give your $1,000 paycheck to them when you get it in a couple weeks.
                These loans are advertised as very short-term loans and can be approved for people with bad credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                What makes pay-day loans predatory is their ridiculously-high APR’s.
                The average APR for a pay-day loan is about 400%.
                Some even get into the thousands.
                Just as a point of reference, mortgage rates are currently around 6-8% and car loans are around 4-9%
            </p>

            <p>
                The true devilry with pay-day loans is in their advertised short term.
                Even with a 400% interest rate, if you only borrow for a week, it isn’t <em>that</em> much, is it? I mean, what is <m>50 or</m>100 for the security of getting the cash you need right now? The issue is that many people who take out these loans do so because they’re in dire financial trouble.
                A pay-day loan won’t fix that.
                Pay-day lenders actually count on you being unable to pay back your loan on time.
                First, they’ll be able to charge you a fee for being late.
                More importantly, you will be in debt to them with that really high interest rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose your bi-weekly paychecks are $1,000 each.
                You need money now for food or rent.
                So, you take out a pay-day loan with an APR of 400%.
                Then they’ll give you about $860-$870 now, and you’ll owe your $1,000 paycheck in two weeks.
                Suppose that two weeks comes.
                You’ve spent that $870 because it’s less than your usual $1,000.
                When your paycheck comes, you simply can’t give the full $1,000 to the lender.
                Say you only give back $500.
                The lender charges you a $100 fee for being late.
                You now owe the lender <m>1,000 - 500 + 100 = \$600</m> at that 400% interest rate.
                With that interest rate, you will owe an extra 15%-16% every two-week period.
                So, two weeks later, when your next check comes, that $600 you owed is now just short of $700.
                At your next paycheck, it will be $800.
                At the next, over $900.
                This scenario is in no way farfetched; it’s very common and is exactly how a pay-day lender wants to operate.
                In fact, <alert>over 80% of pay-day loans go beyond their original pay-back date, just like in the scenario above</alert>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best way to deal with pay-day loans is to never take one out for any reason.
                Of course, that recommendation comes from a great place of privilege.
                Threats of homelessness or being unable to feed your child puts extreme pressures on you.
                Nevertheless, always try to avoid pay-day loans.
                Plead with your landlord for a few more weeks to pay rent.
                Visit the local food bank to feed your family until the next pay day.
                Ask someone you know if you can do some chores in exchange for some cash.
                It may seem embarrassing, but falling under the thumb of a pay-day lender would be far worse.

            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s consider a very different example.
                Most American’s dream of owning a home; most of us need to borrow money to pay for one.
                Taking out a mortgage requires that you can make the needed payments for as long as 30 years.
                If you do not make enough money, have too much current debt, or won’t likely be employed for 30 years, you may not be approved for a mortgage.
                A <alert>sub-prime mortgage</alert> or a <alert>non-qualified mortgage</alert> is mortgage given by a bank to someone who has a high risk of being able to pay back the loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                People are not told that they are taking out a sub-prime mortgage.
                This is because sub-prime mortgages are simply mortgages with no difference.
                The thing is that, because of the higher risk of non-payment, the interest rates on sub-prime mortgages are higher.
                Currently, prime mortgages rates for 30-year loans are around 6%.
                Sub-prime mortgages are around 10%-12%.
                A 12%rate may not seem that high, especially compared to the pay-loan case above.
                However, consider the following scenario: Suppose you find a home that you love that will require you to borrow $250,000.
                If you take out a 30-year loan, here will be your monthly payments for a few interest rates:

            </p>

            <p>
                A <alert>title loan</alert> is somewhat like a home-equity loan in that you take out a loan with your car as collateral.
                That is, if you cannot make payments on the title loan, the lender can take ownership of your car.
                Similar to pay-day loans, what makes title loans predatory is their high interest rates; title loans often come with interest rates of around 200%-300%.
                Again, these loans are targeted to people with poor credit in dire financial situations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most commonly, people who become trapped in title loans end up taking out other loans to make the payments on their title loans out of fear of losing their cars.
                About 20%-25%of people who take out title loans ultimately have their cars taken.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>-Rent-a-Bank Schemes</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                You may have heard that some states have laws governing what interest rates lenders can charge.
                For example, in Massachusetts, even pay-day loans are capped at 26% APR.
                However, pay-day lenders can still charge triple-digit APR’s.
                They can do so from a scheme that popped up in the 1990’s.
                A <alert>rent-a-bank</alert> scheme is one in which a lender wanting to charge really high interest rates offers the loan through a national bank.
                Because national banks operate in most states, the state laws have a provision making them immune to the interest rate caps.
                This practice is very common for retailers who offer “buy now, pay later’’ items.
                For example, a furniture store may let you take a $600 couch home now in exchange for you taking out a $600 at a really high interest rate.
                However, you don’t take the loan out with the furniture store; it is through a bank.
                The furniture store makes a deal with the bank to operate this high-interest loan in exchange for some of the interest profit.
                The store would not be able to do this without the bank because of state laws, but the bank is immune to those laws.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2025, rent-a-bank schemes are mostly online, given the ease to launder money.
                In general, try to avoid taking out loans through retailers.
                Even if they are not doing the rent-a-bank scheme, interest rates will be much higher anyway.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-to-Detect">
            <title>How to Detect a Predatory Loan</title>
            <p>
                There are a number of common things to be aware of that may signal that something is a predatory loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Really high interest rates.
                Most predatory loans have much higher interest rates than the current going rates.
                It is always good to quickly research what average interest rates are for whatever kind of loan you’re considering.
                If the rate you’re offered is much higher than average, you should probably stay away.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Advertisements targeting vulnerable populations.
                If a financial offer seems to be for a traditionally-targeted population, it may very well be predatory.
                Common vulnerable populations include people in poverty, people with bad credit, the elderly, teens and young adults, people of color, and immigrants.
                If a financial product seems to be directed (either directly or subliminally) at one or more of these populations, there may be predatory tactics involved.
            </p>

            <p>
                -High fees.
                Predatory loans often come with a long list of high fees.
                Some common loans do have fees, which is simply part of the market, but predatory loans will have higher-than-average amounts or mysterious fees.
                (I once visited a car seller that had a “9-11 fee of $75 and a “manager’s fee of $250 hidden in the contract.) Make sure to research what current, reasonable fees are for loans, make sure to read about fees in a contract, and ask what fees are part of a loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Aggressive sales tactics.
                Retailers that offer high-interest loans are often more aggressive with sales tactics.
                Salespeople, in general, can be aggressive due to commissions, but it can be worse in predatory places.
                In particular, you may be pressured to sign something.
                If you at all feel pressured to sign a contract, leave and take some time to research and think.
                As an example, my mother once was looking for a car.
                She found one she liked and talked about financials while her trade-in was being inspected.
                She didn’t like the high-interest offer and wanted to walk out, but they refused to give her her car back, threatening her with a lawsuit.
                She immediately called the police, which got the car salesman to give her car back.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Low credit borrowing.
                In connection to targeting vulnerable populations, predatory lenders often do not show signs of caring whether you can repay or not.
                When you take out a mortgage or car loan, your ability to repay the loan will be scrutinized.
                If a lender promises you a loan “when others have said no,’’ that is a huge red flag.

                In Unit 4, I gave you a rule: Never fall into debt! I also broke this by saying that some debt is okay.
            A better rule may be “Never take on bad debt.” However, this doesn’t have the same staying power as “never fall into debt!”
            </p>

            <p>
                “Good debt’’ is debt you take out to better your financial position or adds value (even non-monetary) to your life.
                For example, a mortgage is used to buy a home.
                That loan allows you to live in a place that is your own, and your home will hopefully grow in value.
                A student loan allows you to get an education that will give you life satisfaction and access to higher-paying work.
                A home-equity loan can allow you to borrow cash you don’t have to make improvements to your home that can increase its value.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Bad debt’’ is debt that you don’t use as a tool to better yourself.
                For example, borrowing money to buy a Playstation 5 would be considered bad debt.
                Taking a pay-day loan would be considered bad debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some debt is tricky to classify.
                What about a car loan? A car is useful, but it loses money over time relatively quickly.
                It depends on a number of factors like where you live and work, family structure, what kind of car, how well you care for it, etc.
                What about taking out a loan to buy a pure-bred goldendoodle? For a pet, that would be bad debt.
                However, if that is to help start your own goldendoodle-breeding business, it may be good debt.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-Debt-Happens">
            <title>How Debt Happens</title>
            <p>
                This section will look at some common reasons people fall into (too much) debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Medical bills.
                Health is taken for granted by many people in the US until they don’t have it.
                Tens of millions of people are very under-insured or uninsured, meaning that if they have a large medical issue, they will be stuck paying the full medical bill or a high deductible.
                Medical debt is one of the biggest reasons people fall into debt.
                Fortunately, there are some laws in place that help lessen the pressure of medical debt, such as the one-year grace period before medical debt can be reported to credit agencies.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Overspending.
                Simplifying spending too much money for their budget is one of the most common reasons someone falls into debt.
                In particular, over-using credit cards makes it very simple for someone to become buried in high-interest debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Falling into a predatory loan.
                Predatory loans are generally advertised as a quick-way-out or a get-now-pay-later mechanism, but come with fairly-hidden high interest rates and hefty fees.
                Once starting on one of the loans, it can be difficult to get free.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Student loans.
                Many colleges promise high returns on investments for education.
                While often true, starting salaries right out of college are often not high enough to fund a large amount of student loans.
                Many post-graduates find themselves struggling to keep up with their student loan payments.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Gambling.
                Gambling is addictive.
                The high of small wins can sometimes numb the pain of big losses.
                Millions of American’s throw their money away to gambling and lotteries.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Unemployment.
                In the event of losing a job, without a sufficient emergency fund, someone may need to turn to debt to keep up with living expenses.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Divorce and separation.
                Legal fees, loss of secondary income, and child-support payments can make separation a costly process.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Debt-Problem">
            <title>Do I Have a Debt Problem?</title>
            <p>
                The first step in solving a problem you have is simply admitting (and recognizing) that you have a problem.
                Many people in unmanageable debt don’t realize or can’t accept that they are in dire straits.
                Here are common signs that you may have a debt problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Missing payments.
                If you start missing payments on your bills, that is a huge sign that you are too burdened with debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Ignoring bills or calls from debtors.
                If you find yourself throwing away bills without looking at them or ignoring calls from numbers you know are from your lenders, you may have a debt problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Making minimum payments.
                If you find yourself only making minimum payments on your bills, it may be a sign that your finances are stretched too thin.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Borrowing money to pay other debts.
                If you have to borrow money from one source to pay back a loan from another, you may have a debt problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Regularly asking family and friends to lend you money.
                If you find yourself needing to ask someone else for money, you may have too much debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Using credit cards as a means to borrow and not just for convenience.
                If you use a credit card to purchase everyday necessities like groceries or paying rent (and you’re doing it out of necessity, not just as a means of convenience), that is a sign you have a debt problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                –Being worried about bills.
                If you find yourself stressing over how you will pay a bill, that is a sign that your debt is overburdening you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that no one chooses to be overburdened by debt.
                It is not something that you should feel shame over.
                Most Americans have some debt throughout much of their adult lives.
                Everyone makes some financial mistakes at times.
                Don’t pretend you’re in a more stable position than you are; the sooner you identify any problems, the easier it is to correct.

        <title>Getting Out of Debt</title>
        <p>
            Before we dive into the actual methods people use to get out from debt, we need to really accept that the only way to healthily eliminate debt is to pay it off.
        </p>

        <p>
            <alert>Reducing your debt requires you to make more money or to sacrifice other spending.</alert>
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, it is impossible to reduce your debt if your budget isn’t balanced.
            If you are overspending each month, you won’t be able to pay down your debt.
            So, your first step should be adjusting your expenses or living situation so that you can at least break even each month.
            (See Units 2 and 3.)
        </p>

        <p>
            For this section, we will present two methods for working off your debt.
            Both methods involve examining your debt and strategically paying bills.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-High-Rate-Method">
            <title>High-Rate Method</title>
            <p>
                The first method for paying off debt is the better one long-term.
                The philosophy is simple: pay the most expensive debt first.
                With the <alert>highest-rate method</alert>, you focus on paying your debt with the highest interest rate first.
                Now, always make sure you’re making at least the minimum payments on all your debt.
                However, you will focus any money you can into paying off your debt with the highest interest rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                The logic behind this method is that debt with the highest interest will accumulate more money that you’ll need to pay back over time.
                Debt with lower interest will accumulate slower and can be left on the back burner for a bit.
                Once your highest-rate loan is repaid, move to the next highest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose you have the following debt:

                Each month, you would make the minimum payments on all four loans.
                However, you would put extra money toward your credit card debt.
                Having this extra money to pay toward your credit cards requires you to adjust your spending habits (or make even larger life changes).
                You would continue paying only the minimum amount on the other three loans while paying the credit cards as much as possible until the full $8,000 has been paid.
                You would then move onto your student loans.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the long-run, this method will save you the most money because you are preventing more interest from accumulating.
                However, if your high-interest loans are also large loans, you may not have the satisfaction of completely eliminating a source of debt quickly.

            <p>
                The <alert>snowball method</alert> is a method that is great for seeing progress more quickly.
                However, seeing progress more quickly actually comes at the expense of paying more in interest long-term.
                Under the snowball method, you pay your debt with the smallest amounts first.
                The philosophy behind the snowball method is to get a source of debt eliminated entirely as quickly as possible.
                This not only gives you a great deal of satisfaction early, it also eases the emotional burden more quickly.
                Again, the downside is that your higher-interest loans will accumulate more interest, and you’ll likely need to pay more in the long-run.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the same setup as in the highest-rate method.

                Under the snowball method, you would make the minimum payments on all your debt, but you would put extra money toward your car loan because it has the smallest balance.
                You would continue this each month until the car loan was paid off.
                You would then move onto your credit cards.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are wondering why anyone would use the snowball method if it costs more in the long-run; the answer is psychology.
                Long-term goals are hard to maintain without seeing your progress.
                Imagine trying to lose weight without access to a scale or driving a long distance with no GPS to say how long is left.
                The snowball method can help you stay on track by getting you to a real milestone (paying off one source of debt fully) more quickly.

            <title>Bankruptcy</title>
            <p>
                When a person or business is unable to repay their debts, they may work with the courts to help them come up with a plan to repay the debt.
                This process is called <alert>filing for bankruptcy</alert>.
                Generally, when you file bankruptcy, would agree to a short-term method of repayment, and after that period, your remaining debt is forgiven.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>Chapter 7</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                When you file for <em>Chapter 7</em> bankruptcy, you will agree to having your assets “liquidized,’’ meaning that your stuff is sold for money.
                The court will look at your income, who and what you owe, and all the stuff you own (assets).
                They will appoint a trustee to facilitate the sale of your “non-essential’’ assets, the proceeds of which go to pay off your debts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many things can be identified as assets to be sold.
                Each state has a minimum amount something must be worth to be considered an asset to be sold.
                (No state will make you sell a $5 oven mitt.) Secondary cars, jewelry, investments, collectibles, and other expensive items will certainly be sold.
                Items necessary for survival (basic appliances, primary transportation, basic furniture, etc.) will not be sold.
                (Sometimes primary vehicles can be sold if they are particularly-expensive cars.) Housing is tricky.
                Certainly secondary homes will be liquidated.
                If you do not owe money on your primary home, it won’t be liquidized.
                If you do owe money and have not fallen behind on mortgage payments and do not have much equity, your house may not be liquidized.
                However, if you are behind on your payments, the house will likely be given to your mortgage bank.
                Or if you have a great deal of equity in the house, you may be forced to sell it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once the liquidation process is over, your debts will be forgiven.
                Keep in mind that some debts cannot be forgiven.
                Student loans, tax debt, and child support payments cannot be forgiven.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you find yourself in a position to need to declare bankruptcy, <em>Chapter 7</em> is a good option if you do not have many assets or if your income is low.
                It essentially is a “clean slate.’’ There are income limits for filing <em>Chapter 7</em>.
                Not having many assets means not having much that needs to be sold.
                A lower income will convince the court that a smaller amount of items needs to be sold.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>Chapter 13</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                When you file for <em>Chapter 13</em> bankruptcy, the court will look at your income, expenses, and debt.
                The court will come up with a payment plan for you to follow for 3 to 5 years.
                This payment plan is generally less than what you would be paying on your debt.
                After this 3-to-5-year period, your remaining debt will be forgiven.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Chapter 13</em> is for people with regular incomes. Unlike <em>Chapter 7</em>, you can keep your assets and property. However, there are limits to how much debt you can have for filing <em>Chapter 13</em>. If you have too much debt, you will not be able to file.
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, keep in mind that filing <em>Chapter 13</em> will not eliminate student loans, tax debt, or child support payments.
            </p>

                The Good and Bad of Bankruptcy
            </p>

            <p>
                Bankruptcy is a means of last resort to get out from burdening debt.
                If you have lower income and few non-essential assets, filing <em>Chapter 7</em> can help you get a clean start in a short amount of time (usually about 6 months).
                If you have a regular income and some property, filing <em>Chapter 13</em> can help you work through some of your debt in 3-5 years while keeping your belongings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that declaring bankruptcy is seen as the ultimate sign of being unable to pay back on your loans.
                This means that it will greatly impact your credit rating.
                People who declare bankruptcy often find it impossible to get a loan for several years after declaring.
                Many people lose their homes during their debt crisis.
                While declaring bankruptcy may remove debt to allow you to pay for housing, you may find yourself unable to find a landlord willing to rent to you.
                <em>Chapter 7</em> bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years.
                <em>Chapter 13</em> stays on your report for 7 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bankruptcy should never be “Plan A’’ to get out from a loan.
                Bankruptcy is a situation in which it is necessary for a court to decide how much you can actually pay back.
                You then have a very large mark on your credit that will hinder your financial goals for a long time.
                Bankruptcy is a means of last resort.
                Yes, businesses have used money laundering techniques to get out of big bills through bankruptcy.
                If you’re savvy and unscrupulous enough to do that, you probably don’t need this course.
