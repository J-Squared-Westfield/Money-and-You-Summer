    <title>Unit 10: Housing</title>

    <p>
        In this week, we’ll take one of your primary needs and what will likely be one of your biggest sources of comfort, stress, relaxation, and strife - housing.
        Housing is not a simple idea any more.
        We no longer find a piece of land no one has claimed and build our own shelters.
        We’ve formed cities, communities, work hubs.
        Housing is becoming more complicated and more difficult.
        This week’s work is designed to help you understand the realities of housing in 21st-century United States.

        <title>The Forms of Housing</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we’ll go over the most common forms of housing.
            You are likely aware of houses and apartments, but there are more options out there.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Single-Family-Homes">
            <title>Single-Family Homes</title>
            <p>
                What probably is the the center of most people’s “American dream” is a single-family home.
                A single-family home is what most people think of when we hear the term “house.” A single-family house is a singular building intended for one family unit.
                These houses are embedded in the property around them (can’t be easily moved).
                Single-family homes build to modern standards (“to code”) will have a kitchen with function appliances, at least one bathroom, a living space, and at least one bedroom separated from the living space.
            </p>

            <p>
                Single-family homes come in a variety of shapes, styles, and purposes.
                Depending on a family’s preferences and needs, they may look at bungalows, cottages, ranches, split-levels, etc.
                as their home shape.
            </p>

            <p>
                Single-family homes are great for families looking to have a solid structural building that offers at least a little distance from neighbors.
                They also generally provide private use of the property surrounding the building.
                However, since they take up more space than other types of properties, they are quite rare in city centers, meaning that they are not great options for people who do not like to commute into work.
            </p>

            <p>
                While many people aim to live in a single-family home because of its comfort and privacy, there are downsides.
                Single-family homes are expensive.
                The sole owner of the house is responsible for all the necessary repairs and updates.
                Regular maintenance, such as lawn-mowing, gardening, painting, etc.
                is time-intensive and costly.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Multi-Family-Homes">
            <title>Multi-Family Homes</title>
            <p>
                A multi-family home is a singular building that allows for two or more family units to reside in it without needing to share most of amenities.
                That is, it is a single building that can be “sectioned-off” where ever section has a kitchen, at least one bathroom, a living space, and at least one bedroom.
                Like a single-family home, a multi-family home will be embedded in the property surrounding it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Multi-family homes are very common in New England, particularly in communities that used to be manufacturing centers.
                (e.g.
                Whip manufacturing in Westfield, paper milling in Holyoke, egg-carton production in Palmer.) They offer most of the same benefits as single-family homes.
                There also tend to be more multi-family homes in some city centers, allowing for easier transportation to work.
                One main downside is that the structure must be shared with at least one other family.
                Residents of a multi-family home will be separated only by a wall.
                Property usage must also be shared.
            </p>

            <p>
                Multi-family homes can have a single owner or each sub-unit can be owned separately.
                In the case of multiple owners, the costs of structure and property repairs/upkeep are split among the owners.
                This can cause some conflicts when it comes to agreeing on how to jointly make property decisions.
                Generally, it is cheaper to live in a multiple-family home as compared to a single-family home.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Apartments">
            <title>Apartments</title>
            <p>
                Apartments are similar to multi-family homes in purpose.
                An apartment building is usually a very large structure that includes a large number of individual sub-units.
                (There could be as lows as two or up to hundreds.) Each sub-unit will allow for a family to live.
                In most modern apartments, each apartment unit will have kitchen amenities and a private bathroom.
                Some apartments do not have separate bedrooms (“studio” apartments), but most do.
                Often, there are multiple apartment buildings on one large parcel of land, which collectively are a “complex.” What appliances are available in an apartment varies greatly.
                Almost all will have ovens, but few have dishwashers or private laundry machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Apartments are generally cheaper housing options, on a per-month basis.
                Generally, residents do not own their individual units, which means the owner, rather than the residents, are responsible for most maintenance and upkeep.
                Given their inherent structural capacity to house a large number of families, apartments are very common in city centers, which can allow for easier transportation to work or other necessary amenities.
                They may even allow for life without needing a car.
                The downside of apartment living is the close-contact to neighbors and living space.
                Apartments can be too small for many families.
                It can also be difficult living with other families immediately beside, above, or below you, separated only by a wall.
                There may also be restrictions on what pets you can own.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Condominiums">
            <title>Condominiums</title>
            <p>
                Condominiums, or “condos,” are much like apartments, except that the residents are the owners of the individual sub-units.
                They come with the same benefits of apartments with the added benefit that ownership allows for stability in housing payments and security.
                They also come with all the same downsides as apartments with the added downside of “home-owners’ association” (HOA) fees.
                Because multiple people collectively own the large structure, each owner much “chip-in” for upkeep, repairs, and maintenance.
                This usually requires the condo owners to pay monthly fees into a pool of money to be used for such purposes.
                HOA fees can range from about $100 per month to hundreds per month.
            </p>

            <p>
                Condos are good options for families looking to own their housing but have a smaller budget.
                Condos are also more common than single-family homes in larger cities.
                Condos may not be good options for larger families.
                Like apartments, the available amenities in condos can vary.
                Some may have laundry units, dishwashers, etc.
                Some may not.
                Also, HOA’s may limit what you can do to your unit.
                You may not be allowed to make major constructive changes.
                The HOA may also restrict things such as pet ownership, noise levels, etc.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Mobile-Homes">
            <title>Mobile Homes</title>
            <p>
                Mobile homes are an interesting option.
                As the name implies, a mobile home is one that is meant to be somewhat mobile.
                (Not an R.V.
                though.) With minimal detachments, a mobile home can be lifted and transported elsewhere and re-hooked up to utilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mobile homes are often owned by the occupants, similar to single-family homes.
                However, the land on which they sit are often owned by someone else and must be rented.
                Given their smaller size, usually larger parcels of land will house a large number of mobile homes.
                (“Trailer park.”) Each mobile home will sit on its own sub-parcel that the renter of said parcel will have private access to.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main benefit of a mobile home is the cost.
                Compared to a single-family home, they are much cheaper to own.
                Mobile homes can come in a variety of shapes.
                Most are single-floor units, but they can function as studio-style places or can have a number of separate bedrooms.
                The downside of mobile homes include less privacy than single family homes (smaller land units), less structural soundness, and the fees to rent land.
                In particular, the cost to rent spaces in a “park” have been going up.
                Many parks are now charging $200-$600 per month.
                Also, mobile homes tend to be in more rural areas, making transportation more difficult.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-A-Note-on-Stigma">
            <title>A Note on Stigma</title>
            <p>
                One issue with housing is the wide-spread idea of good/bad.
                Many Americans interpret single-family houses as the “gold standard” of housing.
                Many people see apartment living as less-desirable living for inner-city populations and mobile homes as less-desirable living for rural populations.
                What you have to keep in mind is the historical context in which this arose and the influence of television and cinema.
                Historically, American families lived in homesteads, which had a variety of different shapes and functions.
                These were generally multi-generational homesteads housing three or four generations of families.
                There could be very large one-building homesteads, or homesteads with a few smaller single-family units.
                The main thing is that, for the majority of American history, single-family living wasn’t the gold standard.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the 40’s to the 60’s, rich investors took on property development in which they bought large tracks of land, building housing, and sold that housing to families are apartment owners.
                This, coupled with the the rapid expansion of industry and transportation led many families to seek single-family houses and up-scale apartments.
                This movement became iconicized in media, representing such living as the only type represented.
                Think homes in shows such as “Leave It to Beaver” or “The Brady Bunch.” Or think up-scale apartments in shows such as “I Love Lucy.” Farms, trailer homes, condos, etc.
                were not really seen in media.
            </p>

            <p>
                The important thing is that, what is most commonly seen is what Americans tend to consider as “solid, middle-class life.” However, there is much more diversity into what success looks like.
                If you find yourself looking down on the concept of apartment-living or a mobile home for no reason other than “it’s better” to live in a single-family home, you may be working under hefty society bias.
                Your housing choices should be influenced not just by finances, but also by your current life situation.
                Whether or not children are living with you, being able to physically get around the space, pet ownership, location and transportation needs.
                All these things should be considered when making a decision.
                There are many great reasons to choose an apartment over a single-family home for many families.
                Price, saved time on maintenance, close proximity to grocery stores and work, are all reasons anyone may prefer an apartment life, for example.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I’m getting at is don’t measure your own success based on what your living space looks like.

    <section xml:id="sec-Owning-v-Renting">
        <title>Owning vs. Renting</title>
        <p>
            In American culture, we seem to prioritize owning a home over renting.
            Part of this is the cultural influence of media, as described above.
            Another component is simply based on our roots.
            Full first-class citizenship was originally only for male, white, adult land-owners.
            Not being any of these made you a second-class citizen.
            These days, land ownership is no longer required to participate in governance, but that residual idea of owning land being better still remains.
            However, if you can get past this society bias, then we can compared the practical components of owning your housing vs.
            renting.
            It turns out that there can be a number of different benefits to renting your housing.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Pros-of-Owning">
            <title>The Pros of Owning</title>
            <p>
                One major advantage of owning your housing is <alert>equity.</alert> Equity represents how much of your housing you actually own.
                Most Americans cannot afford housing with cash they have saved up and instead need to borrow money to purchase the home.
                However, when you do this, you don’t really truly “own” the housing.
                If you are unable to make the payments or need to sell the place for any reason, you have to pay back what you owe before you get the sale proceeds.
                For example, if you could sell your housing for $200,000 today (after realtor fees), but you still owe a bank $150,000 for it, you only have $50,000 in practical equity.
                As make your payments on your housing, your equity will increase, which increases your overall wealth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Housing ownership usually comes with <alert>appreciation</alert> as well.
                Generally, housing values go up over time.
                If you buy housing and its value increases, your equity will increase even without you making payments.
                For example, let’s suppose that your house is worth $200,000 and you owe $150,000 on it.
                You have $50,000 in equity.
                If one month later the value goes up to $220,000, your equity is now $70,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inheritance potential is another benefit of owning.
                If you own your housing, that can be passed on to future generations after you pass, potentially easing the burden of your children or grandchildren.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond finances, there are other benefits of owning your housing.
                You generally have more flexibility in customizing your housing.
                For example, you generally cannot install the plumbing needed in a rented apartment, but you can in your owned single-family home.
                Flexibility depends on the actual housing.
                Multi-family homes or places with HOA’s may restrict what you can do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Privacy may be another benefit.
                Generally, owned housing are not in large multi-unit buildings, meaning there are fewer other families in your immediate vicinity, which many people prefer.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Pros-of-Renting">
            <title>The Pros of Renting</title>
            <p>
                One of the biggest benefits of renting is monthly costs.
                Generally, it is cheaper to rent a space than it is to own that space, at least in terms of monthly payments.
                If you would like more of your budget to be used in other areas, renting may be a way to make that happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Flexibility is a big benefit of renting as well.
                If you need to sell housing that you own, it can take time and money.
                For example, if you sell a house that you own, there are some costs to that that you will be expected to pay (realtor fees, for example).
                With renting, it is generally much easier to move from one place to the next.
                For families with jobs that require frequent geographic shifts or who simply like changing locations, renting may be the best way to go.
            </p>

            <p>
                Renters are generally not responsible for most maintenance and repairs.
                While they are responsible for cleanliness, renters usually don’t need to finance new appliances, broken windows (unless it’s their fault), or housing updates.
                Owners should be prepared to spent about 2%of a home’s value on repairs/updates each year (on average).
                Renters do not need to worry about most of these expenses.

            In this section, we’ll go over what it costs to own your own housing.
            For the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume this is for a single-family home.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Mortgages">
            <title>Mortgages</title>
            <p>
                We’ve used the term “mortgage” many times so far, but we’ve never explored them.
                When you want to buy a house but do not have the full costs saved up, you need to take out a loan from a bank.
                The most common type of loan is a “mortgage.” A “mortgage” is simply a loan in which your house is used as collateral.
                So, if you are unable to keep up with your loan payments, the bank can take ownership of our house.
                If this happens, it is called “foreclosure.”
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing about foreclosure is that it is costly for the banks.
                They generally cannot sell a foreclosed house for the full value of the home.
                So, banks generally will not loan out the entire value of a house.
                That is, if you want to buy a house that costs $200,000, a bank will generally not loan you $200,000; you’ll need to pay for some of the house immediately.
                The amount of cash that you pay for a house up front when you take out a mortgage is called the <alert>down payment.</alert> The amount of down payment needed depends on the bank and the type of housing/state of the housing.
                It can also depend on the loan “type.” There are some government-subsidy programs that will allow you to have down payments as low as 3.5%of the house’s value.
                Often, banks require down payments of at least 5%.
                Some may require more.
                If you put less than 20%down, your bank may charge you “property mortgage insurance” or PMI.
                This is essentially insurance the bank gets that will help them recover the full value of your house in case of foreclosure.
                Once you have 20%in equity, you no longer have to pay for PMI.
            </p>

            <p>
                So far, we’ve described “conventional loans.” These are loans for houses that are in good condition with nothing tricky going on.
                However, there are a number of other kinds of loans.
                For example, some people may want a “rehab loan.” With a rehab loan, you borrow money to purchase and fix up a run-down property.
                With these loans, you generally do borrow more than the (current) value of the house.
                The idea is that your property value (and equity) will rapidly rise after the rehab.
                There are a number of other non-conventional loans out there with different terms and purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the biggest determines of your monthly mortgage payments is the interest rate charged.
                As we explored in our work with credit, interest rates are, in part, determined by your credit.
                Interest rates are also determined by geographic location, property condition, and rates set by the FED.
                It is important to pay attention to interest rates.
                A single percent difference can mean the difference between being able to afford a house or not.
            </p>

                There are generally two kinds of interest program available.
                The most common is a <alert>fixed</alert> interest rate.
                With a fixed interest rate, your interest rate cannot change, no matter what, over the life of your mortgage.
                You can technically “change” your interest rate by re-financing.
                However, re-financing is technically a whole new loan.
                There are also <alert>variable-rate loans</alert>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pay attention.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally, <alert>variable-rate loans are dangerous.</alert> Most variable-rate loans have a very low “come-on” rate.
                That rate is then allowed to be changed (almost always increased) after a certain number of years.
                Many families have lost their homes because of variable interest rates when their monthly payments suddenly increased by hundreds of dollars once the new rate kicked in.
                There are some scenarios when a variable interest rate makes sense, but you should generally only consider fixed interest rates.

            <title>Financing a Mortgage</title>
            <p>
                One of the biggest barriers to home ownership is not the monthly payment but the up-front costs to taking out a mortgage.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have gone over down payments, which already require a hefty amount of cash.
                There are other costs as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                Taking out a loan requires <alert>closing costs.</alert> When you actually sign the paperwork for a mortgage and assume ownership of a house, you engage in a process called “closing.” These days, closing requires a number of institutions involved.
                Lawyers are involved to handle the contract drafting and signing.
                Title companies are involved for changing ownership of the house deed and maintaining the deed.
                Banks are needed to actually give the cash to the seller and real estate agents.
                Accountants may be involved for tax purposes.
                All this needs to paid for.
                With the exception of real estate agent fees, all costs for closing, called <alert>closing costs</alert>, must be paid for by the buyer.
                (Technically, since real estate agent fees are incorporated in the house’s price, the buyer also kind of pays for those too.)
            </p>

            <p>
                While, technically, closing costs must be paid for up front, like a down payment, practically, they can be “rolled into” the loan.
                That is, you borrow those closing costs from the bank on top of what you borrow for the house.
                For example, suppose you want to buy a house that costs $200,000.
                The bank requires a 10%down payment, and there are $10,000 in closing costs.
                How much do you need to actually pay up front? You have two options.
                One is to pay the down payment and closing costs in cash.
                10%of the house loan is $20,000.
                So, you would need a total of $30,000 up front.
                The other option is to roll the costs into the loan.
                This effectively makes the implied total house cost $210,000.
                10%of this is $21,000, which is what you’d need to have in cash.
                The benefit of rolling in the closing costs is needing less cash up front.
                The issue is that you’ll be paying interest on the extra borrowed money.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Insurance-House">
            <title>Insurance</title>
            <p>
                If you take out a mortgage, you will be required to have property insurance.
                Even if you don’t owe money on your house, you should have property insurance anyway.
                Insurance is another part of home ownership that is pricing people out of homes.
                The triple whammy of climate change, supply-chain disruptions from COVID, and the most recent tariffs put into place have made the cost of rebuilding a home much more expensive than it used to be.
                This has caused property insurance to sky rocket.
                This is worse in some areas.
                Areas with more hurricanes or wildfires are seeing astronomical insurance surges.
                Some insurance companies are dropping certain damage types from plans, which can drop the monthly costs, but it leaves your home in more danger.
                Also, some banks may not allow you to carry insurance without certain key damage types covered.
            </p>

            <p>
                Property insurance can be hard to navigate.
                Many things influence your monthly rate.
                Also, the difference of one-tenth of a mile can drastically change the rate.
                Flood insurance is a main example.
                Some houses are in a “flood plane,” which often necessitates flood coverage in your property insurance.
                Other houses are often not required to have this coverage.
                Certain building structures may also influence your rate.
                Being surrounded by tall trees may increase the likelihood of damage from wind, which raises your rate.
                If you have a French drain installed, you are more protected from flooding, which may lower your rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                While you have a mortgage on your house, your bank actually makes the insurance payments to the company.
                On top of your loan payment, you will also be charged the insurance premium in your monthly housing payment.
                Insurances costs vary wildly, but expect to pay hundreds each month for coverage.
                As the value of your house goes up and building material costs go up, your insurance payments will also go up.

                As owner of your home, you will be responsible for any property taxes.
                Your taxes are usually paid every six months.
                Much like insurance, your bank actually pays them while you have the mortgage out.
                The cost is spread out over months and are included in your total monthly payments to the bank.
                How much your tax payments are are determined by your home’s “assessed” value and the tax rate set by your city.
                Different cities have different rates.
                Generally, cities with more amenities and more publicly-funded things like parks and what not have higher tax rates.
                You should expect to pay a few to several hundred in taxes each month.
                Usually, your house’s value, which determines your monthly tax cost, is done every two years.

                While there are some programs in Massachusetts to help low-income families with utilities, most are responsible for the full amount.
                Water, heat, electricity, internet, etc.
                are all monthly costs.
                Utilities are usually more costly in the coldest and warmest months of the year.
                Depending on your house’s size and family size as well as location and utility companies, your average monthly cost can vary greatly.
                Expect at least a few hundred dollar each month.

                There are a lot of costs to owning a home beyond what you owe your bank.
                Let’s take an example and break it down.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose you want to buy a home in Westfield that is valued at $250,000.
                Closing costs are $10,000.
                The bank requires that 12%be put down.
                You take out a 30-year loan.
                The interest rate is 6.8%.
                The assessed value is $240,000, and the tax rate is 1.7%.
                Insurance costs are $2,000 per year.
                Utilities average $320 per month.
                You expect to pay $50 per month on cleaning supplies.
                How much would you expect to pay for housing on average?
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If you roll the closing costs into the loan, you put down 12%of 260,000, which is $31,200.
                        That means you borrow the remaining $228,800.
                        Using a mortgage calculator, we find that the loan payments will be $1,491.60 each month.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        1.7%of $240,000 is $4,080.
                        So, the monthly tax payment is <m>\frac{4,080}{12}= \$340.</m>
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        The monthly insurance cost is <m>\frac{2,000}{12}= \$166.67</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Recall that you should expect about 3%of your house’s value each year.
                        That would be <m>250,000\times 0.02 = \$5,000.</m> That works out to $416.67 per month.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        So, putting everything together, the cost of owning a house is <m>1491.60 + 340 + 166.67 + 320 + 416.67 + 50 = \$2,784.94</m>.
                    </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that housing costs go up each year.
                Taxes and insurance go up with your home’s value.
                Utilities and other costs go up with inflation.
                So, always keep this in mind.
                Of course, there will be a point at which you pay off your house, which will means the loan part of your housing expenses goes away forever.

            In this section, we’ll look at all the expenses involved in renting housing.
            For comparison, we’ll look at renting a single-family house.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Rent">
            <title>Rent</title>
            <p>
                The biggest factor of living expenses is rent.
                Rent is what you pay directly to the property owner in exchange for living in/on that property.
                Rent costs depend on a large number of factors.
                Housing size, location, amenities, what utilities are included with rent, landlord greed are just some of the things that dictate monthly rent.
                Essentially, the more it costs a property owner to own (offer the housing to you), the higher the rent will be for that property.
                So, even if you don’t pay the property taxes directly, they will affect the rent on a property.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a sense, rent is simple and somewhat predictable.
                Generally, you can sign a lease with a landlord for 12-month periods, which dictate what your rent will be.
                After your 12-months are up, you can re-sign the lease but for a potentially-different rent.
                Keep in mind that rents do tend to go up year to year.
                Generally, rent increases are to reflect the effects of inflation and housing appreciation.
                Of course, sometimes landlords increase rents beyond this for higher profits.

            <title>The Problem of High Rent Increases</title>
            <p>
                There are some great landlords, some horrible landlords, and everything in between.
                (The same is true about tenants.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep in mind that some annual rent increases should be expected and are perfectly reasonable.
                    If your rent increases by 3%in a year, that is essentially in line with inflation and shouldn’t be seen as some scummy business by your landlord.
                    However, some landlords will try to raise rents way beyond what is reasonable.
                    For example, during the COVID lockdown when the housing shortage was at its worst, it wasn’t uncommon to see rents increase by several hundred dollars year to year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While landlords do have a right to raise rents (after a lease is up), renters do have a number of rights that they can utilize to help out.

                                If you feel that your rent has been increase way beyond what is reasonable, do not immediately start paying that increase rent and do not immediately sign a new lease under that higher rent.
                                Even if you pay the higher rent once without signing anything, you have shown willingness and ability to pay that higher rent.
                                You can’t be evicted immediately.
                                Contact legal help quickly.

                                If your landlord accepts the rent, even if they say you owe more, by taking the money they have shown willingness to accept that original amount as your rent.
                                It also shows that you are not missing rent payments.

                                Take to your landlord and try to negotiate.
                                Don’t take the first offer.
                                Don’t take something that isn’t reasonable.

                                If you landlord decides they would prefer to try to evict you rather than take your original rent payments, they will likely try to do this through civic court.
                                Once this happens, immediately call your local housing court and request to have the case settled there.
                                This is extremely important.
                                In Massachusetts, housing courts are far more likely to side with tenants, especially if they are showing they are paying rent.

                                You do not need to hire a full lawyer, but paying for one sessions with a lawyer for some advice could save you a lot of money.

            <p>
                Generally, landlords want a bit of security regarding rent payments.
                Two common things happen with tenants.
                First, the last month a tenant is in a property can often be ignored in terms of rent.
                That is, if a tenant is leaving, they may choose not to pay the last month in rent, knowing that it is not cost effective for the landlord to try and sue over one single rent payment.
                Second, tenants often cause damage beyond normal wear and teat (putting a hole in the wall, breaking a window, etc.).
                To somewhat protect against these, landlords often require tenants to pay three months worth of rent immediately before moving in.
                This three-months worth of rent represents your first month or rent, your last month of rent, and an amount to be used as security.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under this system, when you leave your rented space, you would not have to pay the last month of rent as you already had when you first moved in.
                (Even if your rent payments when you leave are higher than when you first moved in.)
            </p>

            <p>
                The security is a “deposit.” This means that it should be returned to you after you move out, if there is no damage to the property beyond wear and tear.
                It is recommended that you take pictures of your rented space the day you move in as well as the day you move out.
                If your landlord (unfairly) tries to withhold your security deposit, you can sue through housing court for it back (plus damages).
                Keep in mind that it’s about fairness.
                If you got drunk and punched a hole through the wall, you’re responsible for it.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Utilities-Rent">
            <title>Utilities</title>
            <p>
                Utilities are a big factor in rent.
                Some rents will include your utilities like electricity, gas, sewer, and water.
                Some rents include some of these.
                Some rents include none.
                When utilities are included in rents, your landlords are responsible for those utility payments, no matter how much you actually use.
                When utilities are not included, you are responsible for pay those utilities on top of your rent.
                Keep in mind that internet and cable are rarely included in rent.
            </p>

            <p>
                It may sound like having utilities included is better.
                However, keep in mind that when utilities are included, that is factored into your rent payments.
                Your landlord will make predictions about your utility usage and factor that into what rent amount they charge.
                It is important to shop around.
                Try to predict what you may pay in utilities each month and determine what options give you the best deal.
                (Funny thing.
                Marijuana growers often rent places that include electricity in the rent.
                The grow lights take a huge amount of electricity, which the landlords have to pay for.
                I don’t recommend, since it’s illegal.
                But it’s funny.
                Unless you’re the landlord.)
            </p>

            <p>
                In Massachusetts, landlords are legally required to provide <em>access</em> to hot water and heating.
                This does not mean that they pay for it.
                It means that they can never shut off those utilities for any reason.
                They must also work as quickly as possible to have those utilities fixed if anything needs repairs.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Other-Costs">
            <title>Other Costs</title>
            <p>
                There may be other costs associated with renting.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pets can be an issue.
                Some rented places allow most common pets, no questions asked and no fees.
                Some will allow small pets (cats, hamsters, small dogs).
                Some do not allow any pets.
                Some will let you have pets, but for an added fee each month.
                Common pet fees are $50-$100 per month per pet.
            </p>

            <p>
                While you do not have to pay for repairs (that aren’t you fault), you do need to cover basic cleaning.
                You may need to clean more than you’d like to maintain the standard of cleanliness to avoid losing your security deposit.
                (If you don’t clean you shower and mold starts growing, you may need to pay for the remediation from your security deposit.) Generally, very minor repairs, like replacing a lightbulb, are paid for by tenants.
            </p>

            <p>
                Laundry can be a huge expense.
                Rented single-family homes often have laundry machines.
                Most apartments do not.
                Some apartment complexes have coin-operated laundries in a separate building or basements, but these can be really, really expensive.
                Often, people choose to go to laundromats instead.
                Some apartment complexes will have laundry hook-ups in the spaces and will rent out machines on a per-month basis.
                No matter what, keep laundry prices in mind when you’re thinking about housing.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you rent a single-family home, you will need to discuss whose responsibility it is to cover things like lawn mowing or snow shoveling.
                There is no law on these.
                Sometimes, they’re included in the rent, other times not.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Other-Considerations">
            <title>Other Considerations</title>
            <p>
                There are a number of other things to consider when thinking about renting a place.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every rented property will have occupancy rules.
                Some of these are mandated by a state.
                For example, perhaps you and ten friends want to rent a two-bedroom place for a year so that you all have cheap housing, allowing you to save up money for your own down payments on houses.
                This wouldn’t be allowed by state law.
                (Unless the bedrooms were really large.) You will have to disclose how many people will be living with you when you apply to rent a place.
                Lying on this application can get you evicted.
                It’s a common practice among some tenants, trying to get around occupancy laws.
            </p>

            <p>
                Applications may come with a fee.
                Usually, these are no more than $50-$100.
                Never pay any more than that for an application fee.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some landlords will allow you to make remodels or renovations to properties.
                This is particularly true of rented single-family homes.
                You must always get permission before making any changes, but some landlords are flexible with how you set up your living space.
                Tenants often want to install gardens or laundry hookups.
                Keep in mind that you would be responsible for the full costs of such changes.

        <title>Should You Rent or Buy?</title>
        <p>
            Should you buy your own place, or should you rent? Before you yell out “buy” because of society bias, this question often requires more thought.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Personal-Preferences">
            <title>Personal Preferences</title>
            <p>
                Keep in mind the time and money it takes to keep up a property.
                Do you have time to mow a lawn every week? Can you keep a rainy-day fund to pay for appliances that break? Do you want to paint your property’s rooms every so often? Whether you rent or own can dictate how much time you need to spend up keeping your property.
                Many people do not want to deal with upkeep and purposely rent spaces that allow for more time away from chores.
                Some people who are intent on buying their housing but do not want to handle upkeep personally choose to buy condos.
                On the other hand, many enjoy these kinds of chores and see them as a benefit of owning their housing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Will your housing be the right place for you ten years from now? What about when your retired and having trouble getting around? A very common practice is for retirees to move away from their housing where they raised families and into smaller one-story units.
                Getting up and down stairs can be a real challenge in old age.
                Some also worry about what will happen after they die.
                Some choose to rent places to avoid the messiness of what will happen to their owned homes after they die.
                Keep in mind that it can take time to buy and sell property.
                You want to think about where you and your family will be in the coming years and have a space that is good for you and allows for needed flexibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                Access to amenities is crucial.
                Housing closer to city centers is more expensive than in rural areas.
                This makes apartment-living the more likely option if you want to live in a downtown area of a bustling city.

                    <p>
                        For this first problem, you will go through the process of estimating housing costs.  
                        For this problem, you will pretend that you are looking to buy a condominium in Springfield, Massachusetts.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                First, use a website like realtor.com or zillow.com to do a search for condominium for sale in Springfield, Massachusetts.
                                What is a rough estimate for the average condo price that you're finding?
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Next, we'll assume that you'll need a loan to buy a condo.  
                                Do a quick internet search to determine what the current average interest rate is for a 30-year mortgage.
                                What is the current average interest rate?
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Next, you'll determine how much you'll actually borrow.  Suppose that the bank you choose requires a down payment of 10%.
                                Also, suppose that the closing costs for the loan are $6,500.
                                Using your condo price from part (a), determine how much you'll actually need to borrow from the bank.  
                                You can assume you'll roll the closing costs into the loan.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                We now need to determine the monthly payment to the bank.
                                Use this calculator: <url href="https://www.calculator.net/loan-calculator.html">https://www.calculator.net/loan-calculator.html</url>.
                                Use the top calculator.  For the loan amount, put the amount that you need to borrow (not the house price).  For the interest rate, use the interest
                                rate you found in part (b).  Have the term be 30 years.  Keep the other options as it.  
                                Use the calculator to find your loan payment amount.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Now we'll look at taxes.  Do a quick internet search to find the property tax rate in Springfield, Massachusetts.  
                                Assume the condo cost is also its assessed value.  Use the tax rate you found to determine how much you'll pay in taxes each year.
                                Divide by 12 to find the monthly tax payment.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Condos all come with HOA fees.  Go back to whichever realtor site you used.  
                                In the listings you looked at, there should be information on the monthly HOA fees.  
                                What sees to be a rough average cost for HOA fees?
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Now upkeep.  For condos, some upkeep is paid through your HOA fees.  However, some things you'll need to pay for yourself.
                                A rule of thumb for a condo is that you can assume you'll need about 1% of the condo's value for upkeep each year.  
                                Using the condo value you found in part (a), determine the annual upkeep cost.  Divide by 12 to find the monthly cost.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                For the final step, we'll put everything together.  Assume that insurance for the condo will be $90 per month.  
                                Assume that utilities will be on average $250 per month.  Assume that you'll need about $60 per month in general cleaning and other supplies.
                                Using your monthly costs from earlier parts and these other costs, determine the full monthly cost for owning a condo.
