        <title>An Introduction to Credit</title>
        <p>
            Let’s look at a few very realistic scenarios.
        </p>

                    Alex and Alexa are in the market for their first home.
                    A clean, updated home in a nice neighborhood has just gone on the market for $300,000.
                    They have saved for a 20% down payment plus closing costs.
                    So, they need to borrow $240,000.
                    Banks are currently advertising 5.8% 30-year fixed rates.
                    This would make the basic mortgage cost $1,408 per month.
                    With taxes and insurance, their monthly mortgage payment is $2,074.
                    This amount would just fit into their possible housing budget.
                    When they apply for the loan, they are told that their credit is not great and that the interest rate is going to be 7.2%.
                    This change in interest rate raises the basic loan payment to $1,629, a $221 difference.
                    Alex and Alexa could move a little around in their budget, but not $221.
                    They decide to leave off on buying a home for a few more years.

            Jordan was laid off from work for a number of months during a recession, but they have have just accepted a new job in Boston.
            They don’t have a car and need to live somewhere with decent public transportation options to downtown.
            They have been putting in applications for several apartments, but they are rejected every time.
            They are told that tenants with better credit ratings are the ones chosen to rent the places.
            During their unemployed time, Jordan had to miss a number of bill payments, but they are starting to catch up.
            No landlord is willing to accept their explanation of their situation and choose to just “go with the numbers.” Jordan has to now choose between not taking their new job or living in a place in which the daily commute is hours long.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two scenarios above are not particularly wild or extreme.
            In fact, they are very common.
            Having poor credit can cost you in terms of money, time, and stress.
            The importance of credit has become so mainstream that an entire industry has been built around it.

                    When you hear the term “credit” in the context of personal finance, it refers to a measurement on how trustworthy you are with regards to paying your bills and paying back loans you take out.
                    Giving someone a loan is a risky thing.
                    If someone is unable to pay what they owe you, it can be a very time-consuming endeavor to recuperate even part of the money you are owed.
                    If you are a landlord, it can take 6 to 18 months to evict someone who stops paying rent.
                    So, landlords tend to only rent to those who have shown they can and will pay their bills.
                    Some insurance companies even demand more in monthly premiums to someone with more risky bill-payment history.
                    Some employers may check your credit as well as a gauge of how “responsible” you are.
                    So, it is paramount to your financial health to build and maintain “good credit.”

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-measure-credit">
            <title>How Credit is Measured</title>
            <sidebyside widths="55% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    There are two measurements of your credit.
                    The first measurement is your <alert>credit report</alert>.
                    In actuality, you have a number of credit reports.
                    Each “reporting bureaus” has their own report.
                    The three biggest reporting bureaus are TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian.
                    These credit reports give a snapshot of your current and recent experiences in loan and bill payments.
                    When you apply for a loan or some other thing that requires a “hard inquiry” into your credit, lenders will look at this credit report to make a decision.
                    A credit report will list things like, how much you still owe on your house/car, what your current monthly payments on loans are, credit card 
                    balances, credit card limits, bankruptcies, financial lawsuits, previous credit inquiries, and which monthly payments you have made on time.

            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                The second option of credit measurement is a <alert>credit score</alert>.
                A credit score is simply a single number that summarizes your credit.
                The larger the score, the better.
                Each reporting bureau can use its own method and scale for credit scores.
                There used to be more difference in possible ranges for credit scores, but most models now put all credit scores between 350 and 850.
                The point of a credit score is to give a somewhat-universal measurement of credit that shouldn’t open any more doors to biases in decisions regarding loans.

    <section xml:id="sec-build-credit">
        <title>Building Good Credit</title>
        <p>
            Let's dive into building credit.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-determine-credit">
            <title>What Determines Your Credit?</title>
            <p>
                In this section, we’ll go through the main contributors to your credit report and scores in order of how big of an impact they have.
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Payment History.</alert> (<alert>Very high impact.</alert>) The most important factor in your credit is your history of making payments on loans and certain bills.
                Missing even one payment can wreck havoc on your credit score.
                While not as bad, late payments also can drastically impact your credit.
                Note that a payment is not counted as “late” until it is 30 days past due.
                So, if you have a credit card payment due on July 1st, as long as you pay it by July 31st, the payment is not considered “late” in terms of impacting your credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you pay certain bills, the lender or company will report to the credit bureaus that you have made a payment on time.
                If you are late with a payment or miss a payment, they will likewise report so.
                It takes dozens of reported on-time payments to build your credit up, but it only takes one bad month to lower your score.
                Now all bill payments are reported to credit bureaus.
                All loan payments, such as mortgages, auto loans, equity loans, and personal loans are reported to credit bureaus each month.
                Rent <em>can</em> be reported, but that is up to your landlord to do so.
                Generally, rent payments are not reported unless you miss payments.
                Similarly, utilities, phone, TV, and insurance bills <em>can</em> be reported, but are usually not.
                If you do miss payments, these companies are more likely to sell your debt to a collections agency, which absolutely will report your missing bill payments.
                Fines and tickets are not reported in Massachusetts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Medical debt is tricky.
                It only takes one small thing to happen for medical debt to pile up.
                If you have an emergency medical procedure that your insurance doesn’t cover, you could be looking at hundreds of thousands of medical bills.
                A common false belief is that missed payments on medical debt can’t be reported for Massachusetts residents.
                This is false.
                It absolutely can.
                Many medical providers choose not to report themselves, but collections agencies absolutely will.
                However, since medical debt is seen as involuntary debt (choosing to take out an auto loan is never life-or-death), there is some leniency.
                First, medical debt of less than $500 will never hurt your credit.
                This is because it is really common to have to fight with your medical insurance company over co-pay amounts and whatnot, which takes time.
                Second, once your unpaid medical payments are reported to a credit bureau, the bureau cannot legally affect your credit report for 365 days from the day they are told about your missed payments.
                Paid medical debt is no longer report as well, meaning once you pay medical debt that went to collections, it is removed from your report.
                Further, some credit score models do not take into account unpaid medical debt.
                There are talks about eliminating all medical debt from credit reports, but that is looking less likely under the proposed goals of the new administration and legislature.
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Amount Owed.</alert> (<alert>Very high impact.</alert>) In general, the more you owe, the more risky it is to let you borrow more money.
                Even you you have a very high income and can afford a large mortgage or auto loan, large loan amounts will hurt your credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Percentage of <alert>credit utilization</alert> also affects your score.
                Owing $10,000 in credit card debt is much worse if your credit limit is $15,000 versus $50,000.
                (66.7%credit utilization versus 20%.) Ideally, you want to keep your credit utilization below 10%of your total “revolving-credit” accounts.
                (<em>Revolving credit</em> is a type of open-ended loan in which you can borrow up to a pre-approved amount.
                Credit cards and home-equity loans are examples of these.)
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Length of Credit History.</alert> (<alert>Moderate impact.</alert>) This is one you don’t have much control over.
                Lenders, employers, etc.
                would prefer to see you have 25 years of good credit history versus one year of credit history.
                Credit history is usually determined to be either the age of your oldest account or the average age of all your accounts.
                For example, if you opened your first credit card five years ago and opened a second credit card one year ago and no other types of accounts, your “credit age” could be either 5 years or 3 years (average of 1 and 5), depending on the reporter’s model.
                I didn’t pull 25 years out of thin air.
                That is usually the credit age needed for the best positive impact to your score.
                Again, don’t stress over credit age.
                Once you have an account open, you just have to wait.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some nuances to this.
                If you pay off a loan, that account is called “closed.” Closed accounts stay on your credit report for up to ten years and continue to contribute to the “age” of your credit.
                After 10 years, closed accounts disappear, suddenly changing your “credit age.” Also, not using available credit can be seen negatively.
                Some credit card companies close your credit cards if you do not use them for some period of time (often a year).
                So, it is in your best interest, if you can, to keep your oldest account open.
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Credit Mix.</alert> (<alert>Lower impact.</alert>) Lenders like to see that you are capable of paying a variety of types of bills.
                Having one credit card and no other types of accounts or loans makes it look like you have too narrow of credit history.
                So, most credit reporting models favor having kinds of both installment debt (mortgage, student loans, etc.) and revolving accounts (credit cards and equity loans).
                Even though have a broader mix of credit types helps your credit score, <alert>the impact is not worth taking out new loans or opening more credit cards just to improve your credit score.
                Be smart about loans and credit cards.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Credit Inquiries and New Accounts</alert> (<alert>Lower impact.</alert>) Statistically, if you take on more debt, you are more likely to miss a payment on older debt.
                So, opening new accounts tends to lower your credit rating.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, when a company or person needs to check your credit report, they “pull you credit report” or “run an inquiry.” When you apply for a home loan, the bank will pull your credit report to determine if they are willing to give you a loan and what rate they are willing to give you.
                Even if you do not actually take out the loan, this credit check will hurt your credit rating a bit.
                There are two types of credit checks.
                A <em>soft credit check</em> is a check companies do to find out who they would like to offer you something.
                Credit card companies are the biggest users of soft inquiries in that they look for people with scores in certain ranges to market particular credit cards.
                Since you do not authorize these checks, soft credit inquiries do not affect your credit at all.
                A <em>hard credit check</em> is one that a lender will do when you apply for a loan or credit card.
                These do lower your credit rating.
            </p>

            <p>
                The decrease in credit ratings from hard credit inquiries is usually small and very temporary, assuming you make payments on all your bills on time.
                Further, if you “rate-shop” and apply for loans at a few places in a short time-frame, those multiple checks are often counted as only one “credit inquiry.”
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Starting-Credit">
            <title>Starting Your Credit Journey</title>
            If you have never taken out a loan or opened a credit card, you may be what is called a “ghost” - someone without a credit history.
            <p>    
                We all start out as ghosts.
                My generation (millennial) had a saying when we were hitting the job market.
                “To get a job, you need experience.
                To get experience, you need a job.” A similar adage is true for credit.
                “To build credit, you need credit.” That is, in order to show someone that you can be trusted with their money, you have to have already shown that you can be trusted with money.” Some people decide they want to start building credit, but find they are rejected due to having no credit history.
                This section is about starting your credit journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first option comes with a huge disclaimer.
                Promise me you won’t make any decisions until you complete understand how credit cards work and their dangers.
                Promise? Good.
                Opening your first credit card account is a quick way to start building a credit history.
                If you can demonstrate that you can use a credit card responsibly, and make all payments on time, you’ll see a strong start in your credit.
                However, credit cards have the potential for enormous debt that is easy to fall into.
                Never open a credit card unless you are 100%sure you can use it responsibly.
                We will go over credit cards in the the next section.
                If you are determined to open a credit card but do not trust yourself not to overspend, you ask your parents/guardians to hold onto it for you and only use it to buy one small thing a month, like a pack of gum or a coffee.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you do not trust yourself with a credit card or cannot get a credit card, a <em>secured credit card</em> may be an option.
                When a financial instrument is “secured,” it means its tied to a relatively safe asset.
                A secured card is tied to a bank account, making it function much like a debit card.
                To open a secured credit card, you usually deposit money into a bank account, called a “security deposit.” You are issued a credit card with a limit equal to what you put into the account.
                You cannot spend the money from your security deposit.
                Each month, you pay your credit card bill from your (different) regular account.
                If you miss a payment, the bank used the money in your security deposit account.
                A secured card is a way to build credit with less risk of falling to credit card debt.
                So, it can also help with anxiety around credit cards.
                Secured credit cards are meant to be temporary.
                Once you’ve built some credit and feel less anxious about credit cards, it may be time to move onto a regular credit card.
                There is one caveat.
                <alert>Not all secured cards report to the credit bureaus,</alert> which makes them pointless for building credit.
                Make sure the one you want is from a bank that will report to at least one of the three reporting bureaus.
            </p>

            <p>
                This one takes a lot of communication and trust.
                You can build some credit history by becoming an “authorized user” on someone else’s credit card account.
                Most commonly, parents or spouses add someone as an authorized user.
                The benefit is that all reports from the credit card company regarding on-time payments now goes to your report as well.
                However, being an authorized user means that you essentially have access to whatever credit the primary user has.
                For example, if your parents have a credit card with a $20,000 limit (much higher than the usual $500 limit for a first credit card), you have access to the spending power of that $20,000, but your parents are responsible for the payments.
                It takes a great deal of open communication, planning, and trust for this arrangement to work.
                One option some of my friends’ families did when we were young adults was to make their child an authorized user but did not actually give them the credit card or any of the information.
                The idea was to help their kids build credit without the risks of a teenager doing something foolish with a high-limit credit card.
                A few (emphasis on few) credit cards allows primary users to set separate spending limits for authorized users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some small banks and credit unions offer “credit-builder loans.” These loans don’t make much sense on the surface, but they are effective at building credit.
                With a credit builder loan, you apply for the loan but do not get the funds right away.
                They are held in an account.
                You then make payments for this loan (with interest) as you would for a normal loan.
                Once the loan is paid off, you get the loan amount you actually applied for.
                For example, suppose you take out a credit builder loan of $1,000 at 7%interest for one year.
                You do not get that $1,000 right away as you would with a traditional loan.
                Instead, you would make monthly payments of about $86.53 per month.
                Notice that you would pay <m>86.43 \times 12 = \$1,038.36</m> in total.
                At the end of the year and after you made all you payments, you would get that $1,000.
                Yes, you lose money, but that is because it is a loan.
                You have to pay interest.
                Think of it as paying $38 to start building your credit.
                Because credit builder loans are small (usually about $1,000), big banks don’t deal with them.
                Some online banks do, but they are usually predatory and trick you into a really high interest rate.
                If you go this route, go with a local credit union.
            </p>

            <p>
                In general, it takes about six months of on-time payments to establish a credit history.
                This in no way means you’ll have a great credit score in six months, but you will have some history, and you will have access to better credit cards, loans, more apartments, etc.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Maintaining-Credit">
        <title>Maintaining Your Credit</title>
            <p>
                Once you've established some credit, you want to maintain your credit and continue to build it overtime.  
                We'll go over a few things that will help you stay on top of your credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                - The first is more of a general philosophy.
                I’m going to give you a rule.
                It’s overly-simplistic and requires some caveats, but it is a solid rule for maintaining your financial health, particularly with respect to credit.
            </p>
                <alert>Never go into debt.</alert>
            <p>
                That requires some explanation.
                Some debt is okay and often unavoidable.
                A reasonable mortgage or car loan are examples of okay debt, but those are predictable and expenses you would likely have no matter what (housing and transportation).
                The above rule is directed at things like credit card debt, home equity, personal loans, payday loans, etc.
                A more apt rule might be, “never take on debt you can’t afford,” but that doesn’t stick with you as much as “never go into debt.” Make whatever changes are necessary to avoid falling into debt.
                The debt will become a burden.
            </p>

            <p>
                - In a similar vein, the second recommendation is to never buy something with a credit card that you don’t have the cash to pay for.
                If you don’t have the full cost of a TV saved up and able to be used without draining your savings, then do not buy the TV with a credit card.
                It is easy to amass well over $10,000 in credit card debt with minimum payments that grow and grow.
                If you only purchase what you know you can afford, you can go through life without paying a penny in credit card interest and never amass debt.
                A good mindset is to think of your credit cards as a debit card in which each swipe/tap directly withdraws from your cash account.
                They aren’t, but having that mindset can help control spending.
            </p>

            <p>
                - Set up automatic payments for bills.
                It is easy to get a bill in the mail and forget about it for a while until it’s late.
                Automatic payment eliminates that scenario.
                If you can, set your credit card payments to automatically pay your full balance each month.
                This way, you’ll never pay any interest and won’t amass any debt.
                (Only do this once you have a solid budget and are comfortable enough with your spending that you won’t have money you need for rent or some other necessity automatically withdrawn.)
            </p>

            <p>
                - Check your credit reports regularly.
                By law, the credit bureaus have to give you free access to your credit reports once each year.
                Make use of that.
                Most credit cards these days have a benefit that allows you to access a pared-down version of your report whenever you want.
                If you have access to that benefit, do so at least one a month.
                You want to look out for irregularities.
                Mistakes happen sometimes.
                One small billing error may make your auto loan bank mistakenly report you as missing a payment.
                Maybe something went to collections, and you didn’t know.
                Maybe someone committed identity fraud and opened an account in your name.
                It is important to keep a lookout for irregularities on your credit reports and contest anything that is incorrect.
            </p>

            <p>
                - Put a “credit freeze” on your accounts.
                A credit freeze is when you tell the reporting bureaus not to allow anyone to access your credit report.
                This prevents anyone from taking out any loan in your name or applying for credit cards in your name.
                It also significantly reduces the amount of junk mail you get since companies can’t access your report to target you for advertising.
                However, by “anyone,” I mean everyone, including you.
                So, if you need to apply for anything that requires a credit check, you actively need to remove the freeze or do a temporary removal (called a “thaw”).
            </p>

            <p>
                - If you become comfortable with your own responsible credit card spending habits, every now and then ask for a credit limit increase.
                Having a higher credit limit lowers your overall credit utilization, which is seen positively by lenders.
                Of course, never request a spending limit increase if you are building credit card debt; the last thing you want in that situation is more room to amass more debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                -If you go “rate-shopping,” try do so in a short time span (about two weeks).
                Shopping around for the best interest rate with hard credit checks needed for each will be treated as one inquiry if they are all made around the same time.
                If they’re spread out over a couple months, you can hurt your credit a fair amount.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Have an emergency or rainy-day fund that can pay about three months of your required payments.
                If you find yourself out of work, on disability, parental leave, etc., your bills don’t stop.
                Have a fund to help you make it through until you can find employment again.

        <title>Credit Cards</title>
        <p>
            Love them or hate them, credit cards are one of the pillars of the global economy.
            (I’ve even heard that some people believe credit cards are the “mark of the Beast” from the book of Revelations.) 
            In this section, we’ll go over what credit cards are, how they work, how to get them, and responsible use of credit cards.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Revolving-Credit">
            <title>Revolving Credit</title>
            <p>
                Credit cards are the most prominent example of a “revolving” loan.
                When you are issued a credit card, the issuing company is agreeing to give you a loan up to a set dollar amount called a <alert>credit limit</alert>.
                Unlike an installment loan in which you have to use the borrowed money for a set thing (car, house, education, etc.), a revolving loan gives much more freedom to what you can use the borrowed money for.
                Also unlike installment loans, paying off the balance of a revolving account does not close the account, you can continue to borrow up to your credit limit.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are other kinds of revolving loans.
                Payday and other personal loans are usually revolving loans.
                Just like payday loans, credit card loans have many dangers, such as high interest rates and a very easy path to amassing too much debt.
                However, when used responsibly, credit card loans present a much better option for making purchases than other revolving lines of credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main benefit of a credit card is being able to make purchases without needing to carry cash with you.
                Of course, personal checks also fit that bill, but fewer and fewer places are accepting personal checks.
                Of course, online shopping is very difficult without a credit or debit card.

            <title>The Economics of Credit Cards</title>
            <p>
                The economics of credit cards is somewhat complex, but it can be helpful to know some of the monetary motivation for their existence.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, let’s talk about payment card companies.
                In the United States, the payment card industry is dominated by four companies: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express.
                These companies collect, store, process, and transmit all data related to debit cards and credit cards.
                So, these companies are data-storage companies.
                In terms of making loans via cards, some payment card companies do this themselves (such as American Express and Discover).
                Others have “member banks,” that use the payment card’s data services to issue loans (such as Visa and Mastercard).
            </p>

            <p>
                All payment card companies make money via fees.
                Have you ever been to a store that charges higher prices or a purchase minimum price when paying with a credit card? This is because payment card companies charge a fee to businesses for their services.
                Payment card companies charge different amounts, which can cause businesses to only use certain companies.
                Visa and Mastercard generally charge lower fees, which is why many small businesses do not accept Discover or American Express cards.
                Fees are often percentage based (1.5%-3.5%) along with a per-transaction fee ($0.10 - $0.80).
                Historically, businesses set their prices uniformly to account for these fees.
                Some businesses have begun offering lower cash-only prices to be more competitive (gas stations, for example).
                Some cards have fees that are paid by the cardholder, called <alert>annual fees</alert>.
                Lastly, member banks that use payment card services pay a fee for those services.
            </p>

            <p>
                Member banks (and payment card companies that are their own banks) make money via annual fees and interest.
                Not all credit cards have annual fees, but all will have interest.
                The interest rates on credit cards tends to be very high (usually 15%- 30%).
                Given that home and auto loan interest rates are about 6%currently, credit cards can generate a massive profit for these member banks.
                However, you do not have to actually pay any interest on credits card.
                We’ll explain how soon.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-to-Get-Card">
            <title>How to Get a Credit Card</title>
            <p>
                To get a credit card, you need to apply for one.
                As mentioned above, a credit card is the mechanism for a revolving line of credit, meaning that it is a loan.
                As with all loans, you need to apply for it.
                You apply for a credit card via a member bank (or the payment card company itself if it is its own bank).
                The biggest member banks are companies such as Chase, Capital One, Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc.
                Smaller banks <em>can</em> issue their own credit cards, but usually don’t.
                Smaller banks do usually issue debit cards, which still require the services of a payment card company.
            </p>

            <p>
                As with any loan, applying for a credit card usually requires a credit check.
                (If a credit card issuer doesn’t require one, it is likely a very scammy and dangerous card.) Depending on what services and benefits come with a particular credit card (which we’ll discuss soon), credit card issuers may restrict approvals to people with sufficiently good credit history.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-credit-card-works">
            <title>How a Credit Card Works</title>
            <p>
                When you are approved for a credit card and have one, you are ready to make purchases with it.
                When you use a credit card at a business, whether in-person or virtually, you are actually requesting your credit card issuing bank to give you a loan for that purchase amount.
                The request is automatically transmitted to the issuing bank, which will very quickly determine if you will get the loan to pay for whatever it is you’re buying.
                In making this decision, the issuing bank’s computer will look at whether the purchase will exhaust your credit limit, where you are making the purchase, and the amount.
                There are a variety of reasons for a transaction not to be approved, but most are.
                If you exceed your credit limit or the purchase requests seems out of character for your buying habits, the transactions may be denied.
                You can always call the banks if you think the purchase should be approved.
                (For example, if you travel far away from home and use a credit card, the bank may think your card was stolen and just needs to be told that it is indeed you making the purchase.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have made a purchase using the borrowed money from your credit card issuer, you have taken out a loan for the purchase amount.
                Like any loan, you have to pay it back, and your loan will accumulate interest.
                We will go over interest in a later week.
                For now, just understand interest as essentially the cost to you for borrowing money.
                The higher the interest rate, the higher the cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike an installment loan, there is not a set schedule in which you pay off your loan.
                The bank will determine what is called your <alert>minimum payment amount</alert>.
                The minimum payment is the absolute smallest amount you have to pay monthly to pay off your loan.
                How much the minimum payment is depends on a few factors, but it is mostly determined by how much you owe the bank in total.
                You can absolutely (and should) pay more than the minimum payment each month.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the thing about minimum payments.
                <alert>Paying only the minimum payment on a credit card will lead you to never paying off the loan.
                You’ll just accumulate more and more debt through the high interest rates.</alert> So, it is generally in your best interest to pay more than what is minimally required.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are wondering why anyone would use a credit card if the loan interest rates are so high, I have an important fact about every credit card in the U.S.
            </p>
                <alert>You never have to pay a penny in interest on a credit card.</alert>
            <p>
                Here is why and how.
                By law, every credit card issuer has to allow a <alert>grace period</alert>.
                Every credit card company has a monthly billing cycle.
                All purchases made with a credit card in one monthly cycle are treated as one big loan, essentially.
                For purchases in one billing cycle, the actually terms of the loan (interest) cannot kick in until the end of the grace period, which is usually 3-4 weeks.
                <alert>If you pay off your credit card balance before the end of that grace period, the bank cannot charge you any interest at all.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                So, if you pay off the full balance of your credit card every month, you will never, ever pay a single penny in interest.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are responsible with a credit card and only make purchases you have the money for in your personal savings account (or cash), then paying off your credit card each month is easy.
                First, most banks let you choose which day of the month your bills are due.
                Many people choose the 1st or last day of a month.
                Second, you can set up automatic payments so that the credit card issuing bank withdraws whatever you balance is each month (rather than a set dollar amount).
                By setting up automatic payments, you don’t have to worry or think about credit card debt or interest.

                While eating dinner with your significant other’s family, your SO’s father mentions that he’s never owned a credit card.
                He explains that because of the high interest rates on credit cards, it’s always cheaper to pay everything by cash and check.

        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Credit-Card-Benefits">
            <title>Credit Card Benefits</title>
            <p>
                Beyond the convenience of credit cards, some issuing banks offer other perks.
                Essentially, the issuing banks expect (on average) to generate a lot of profit via interest.
                There is also a great deal of competition for you and your potential to pay interest.
                So, some card issuing banks offer incentives for choosing their cards.
                These benefits vary wildly.
                A “cash back” card will essentially return a small percentage of a purchase amount to you.
                (1%-5%, depending on the card and location of purchases.
                Most are around 1.5%these days.) Some cards offer discounts on certain products via agreements they make with companies.
                (For example, Marriott may offer a discount on hotels if the purchase is made through your credit card bank in exchange for the bank advertising Marriott to you.) Some cards offer services such as travel planning, event ticket buying, stream service membership, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cards that offer these additional benefits many not be a simple add-on service.
                Cards that offer benefits are more likely to charge annual fees.
                You have to make a decision as to whether an annual fee is worth it.
                Some benefit-bearing cards to not have any annual fee.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, the better the benefits of a card, the more scrutiny is used in determining if you are eligible for the card.
                That is, some cards require you to have sufficient high credit to be eligible.
            </p>

            <p>
                For those just entering the credit-card benefit world, I tend to suggest finding a cash-back card that does not charge an annual fee.
                If you pay off your balance every month, you never pay interest, but you do still get the “cash back.” This combination essentially makes your purchases cheaper.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Credit-Limits">
            <title>Credit Limits</title>
            <p>
                There is an upper bound to how much you can purchase with a credit card.
                Your credit limit is the most your card issuing bank is willing to loan you.
                One common misconception is that a credit limit is the most you can spend per purchase.
                That is incorrect.
                A credit limit is the most you can purchase in total.
                If, either by a purchase or interest, your credit card balance reaches your credit limit, your are “maxed out.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In general, credit limits are tied to a few key factors.
                Your credit rating, annual income, loan balances, and other assets will determine what your card-issuing bank will set as a credit limit.
                For your first credit card, credit limits are often $500 or $1,000.
                Credit limits can be much, much higher for those with good credit and large incomes.
            </p>

                Credit limits are very malleable.
                Often, your card bank will change your credit limit automatically.
                In times of economic downturns, banks often lower credit limits as a form of risk management in case many of their cardholders lose the jobs.
                In times of economic booms, banks may increase credit limits.
                If a bank determines that you do not use much of your credit limit each month, it may lower your credit limit.
                If you make purchase close to your credit limit or have amassed a large credit card balance, the bank may increase your credit limit to encourage more spending.
            </p>

            <p>
                Automatic credit limit increases can be a bit of a trap, particularly if you are carrying a balance month to month that accrues interest.
                It is in the best interest of the credit card bank for you to amass credit card debt while making the low monthly payments.
                Particularly for people with a spender money personality, increasing credits limits can encourage poor money management and exacerbate debt issues you already have.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately, you can often request changes in your credit limit.
                In particular, requesting a lower credit limit is easy.
                If you find yourself making too many purchases with your credit card each month, requesting a lower limit may help keep spending down.
                On the flip side, you can sometimes request a limit increase.
                This can be helpful as you get older and start making more money and making more purchases.
                Requesting a credit limit increase usually requires approval and will consider factors like current credit balance, purchase history, and income.

            <title>Using a Credit Card Responsibly</title>
            <p>
                If you are getting excited about a credit card, this section is to help bring you down to reality.
                Credit cards have the potential to be very dangerous.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s consider a realistic scenario.
                Suppose Manny gets his first credit card with a $1,000 limit and an interest rate of 25%.
                He doesn’t not have much in savings and makes just enough to get buy.
                Excited to have access to $1,000 to spend, Manny buts a Playstation 5 and a game for (after tax) $600.
                After the grace period and his credit card bill is due, Manny only pays the minimum amount of $25, leaving his balance at 600 - 25 = $575.
            </p>

            <p>
                Manny checks his credit report via his credit card’s website and finds that his credit score dropped 10 points because he has “high credit utilization.” While disappointed, Manny is still happy he has his Playstation and $425 left that he can use.
                Before getting his credit card, Manny couldn’t get a lot of things.
                He decides to start ordering Door Dash and spends $200 is the next billing cycle.
                When the next bill is due, the interest from his previous month causes his balance to grow to $587.
                Adding this month’s Door Dash purchases makes his total balance $787.
                Once again, he makes the minimum payment of $25.
                So, now he has a balance of 787 - 25 = $762.
            </p>

            <p>
                His credit score drops even more as his credit utilization ration has grown.
                Seeing that Manny has approached his credit limit, his bank adjusts his credit limit to $3,000, meaning Manny has 3,000 - 762 = $2,238.
                Excited with having more spending power, Manny begins purchasing things he’s always wanted but could never afford such as more games for his Playstation, accessories for his car, some rare collectible figurines, etc.
                He spends another $1,000 this month.
                The interest on his $762 balance raises it to $778.
                Adding the new $1,000 brings a total loan balance to $1,778.
                He pays all he can afford - the $25 minimum payment for a final balance of $1,753.
            </p>

            <p>
                Manny starts to get worried.
                His credit rating is declining each month.
                That $1,753 is a large amount he owes.
                He determines to get his spending back into shape.
                He cuts up the credit card, preventing him from using it.
                He promises himself he will continue to pay off the credit card debt slowly and steadily.
                The next month, interest has caused his balance to increase to $1,790.
                Manny can again only afford the minimum payment of $25.
                So, his next balance is $1,765.
            </p>

            <p>
                Manny is dismayed that his balance is going up despite now making any more purchases.
                His credit rating is hurting.
                Each month, despite making payments, his balance is going up and up.
                Manny’s anxiety starts going through the roof.
                He knows he will need to eventually find a better job, but he is worried his credit be a problem.
                He knows he needs to make larger payments on his credit card, but he doesn’t have room in his budget.
                Manny feels trapped underneath his credit debt and doesn’t see a way out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Manny’s situation is far from unusual or contrived.

            <title>Debrief</title>
            <p>
                I’m hoping you are coming to understand how easy it is to fall into credit card debt.
                People usually fall into credit card debt for one of two reasons.
                First is similar to Manny’s issue: overspending.
                Credit cards make it really easy to purchase items that don’t fit into your budget.
                Fortunately, this debt is easy to avoid.
                Just don’t buy the wants you can’t afford.
                Of course, that is often easier said than done, particularly for those with strong present bias or social bias.
                The key is to interpret a credit card as a tool that makes purchasing more efficient with money you already have.
                A credit card should never be seen as a method to get what you can’t afford.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other common way people fall into credit card debt is a sudden, unexpected bill.
                From a large medical deductible from a sudden injury to a massive car repair bill, many people put large expenses they don’t have the cash for onto their credit cards to give themselves more time to pay.
                The easiest way to avoid this situation is to have a solid emergency or rainy-day fund.
                Remember that you should try to have at least three months (or even sixth months) worth of your monthly needs amount saved up for emergencies.
                If you find yourself in a situation in which you have a large bill due but no emergency fund to pay for it, there may be some options.
                With a large medical bill, remember that there is a full year period after a bill is reported as late for you to pay before any negative information can be put on your report.
                Also, many hospitals will work with you to set up payment plans.
                For other large bills, you can ask about payment plans.
                Many businesses are willing to work with you.
                You may also be able to hold off on accumulating such bills for a while as you save money.
                For example, if your car breaks down and needs a large repair, it may be possible to use public transportation for a few months as you save money to repair it.
                (A few months without paying for gas or insurance adds up.)

            <title>Activity: Helping Manny</title>
            <p>
                Manny’s situation is not uncommon at all.
                It really only takes a few purchases that you can’t afford to bury yourself under credit card debt.
                Getting out from credit card debt is not easy, but it is possible.
                This activity has two tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            First, analyze what went wrong with Manny’s scenario.
                            How should he have behaved with his new credit card?
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Next, come up with three realistic ways Manny could help lower his credit card debt.
                            Try not to use deus-ex-machina examples, like getting his parents to pay his debt or him suddenly finding a much better-paying job.
                            Just as a point of reference, doubling his monthly payment to $50 would still take almost 6 years for manny to pay off the debt and would cause him to pay a total of about $1,500 in interest on top of the $1,800 his purchases actually cost.

                I am hoping that some of your ways to help get Manny out of debt required some sacrifice on Manny’s part.
                Often, getting out from credit card debt requires you to make some significant changes in your life and your budgeting.
                It’s never easy.
                If often requires you to significantly lower what you can spend on wants each month.
                In extreme cases, you may even need to move into lower-quality housing with cheaper rent payments.

                </p>

                <p>
                    With this calculator, you can estimate how much you will pay on credit card purchases if you only make the minimum payments.
                    The average interest rate is currently 22%.
                    Most often, credit card banks calculate the minimum payment amount as 2%of your current balance (for balances of $1,000).
                    Using those figures, determine how much you would pay for each of the following credit card purchases, if you only paid the minimum amount.
                    (Note that the figure it gives you is just interest.
                    So, also include the purchase amount.
                    For example, if you buy something for $1,000 and the total interest paid is $500, the total amount you pay would be $1,500.

                        Below are some common things people do in life.
                        For each, determine if it would likely raise their credit score, likely lower their credit score, or have no impact on their credit score.
