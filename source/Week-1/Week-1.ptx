        <title>Welcome to Money and You!</title>
        <p> Welcome to Money and You!

            I am thrilled that you are part of my course.  I hope that this course will end up being one of your most useful in your undergraduate curriculum.  
            Understanding personal finance and how you think and act about money can benefit you in a number of ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Money and You is a twist on a traditional personal finance course.  Over the semester, you will learn the fundamentals of managing your money, 
            which you will be able to use for the rest of your life.  You will learn techniques for setting a budget; why and how to build credit; the process, 
            benefits, and drawbacks of buying a home; the world of insurance; taxes as they apply to you; loans and debt; car-buying; scams; saving for 
            retirement; using modern finance tools; and setting financial goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The twist on this course is the opportunity to reflect on how you (individually) behave around and think about money.  You will develop techniques 
            to manage stress about money, explore how money can affect your relationships, reflect on why you want certain things, explore your feelings about 
            risk and reward, and consider why long-term financial goals can be difficult without the proper mindset.

                    This course is not a <q>how to get rich quickly</q> lesson.  It is more of a <q>how to accumulate wealth slowl</q> course.  Let's just get 
                    this out of the way now.  If there were a proven track to move into the upper class, it wouldn't be some secret that is easily 
                    divulged in a self-help book or class.  The course is about setting and achieving <em>realistic and manageable</em> financial goals.

            <p>  
                This course is not a course on investment techniques.  We will cover how to save for retirement, which can involve investing, but 
                we will not explore specific investment strategies like picking particular stocks or trying to predict the crypto market.  We will 
                explore what finance experts do with their own money and why.  We will explore general strategies for saving.  We will not make any 
                speculations or bets on particular investment opportunities.

                Cards on the table, I am a professor of mathematics.  However, this course is not a mathematics course.  Of course, there will be 
                numbers since money is a quantitative object.  You will not need to memorize complex formulas.  You will need to be able to 
                understand some arithmetic and how to apply arithmetic in the context of some applied problems, but you will have access to pretty 
                much all computational tools you would like.

                Let's talk about the expectations and norms for this class.

                <p>
                    First and foremost, everyone should feel welcome and included in this class.  Each of us comes into this class with different 
                    experiences, identities, ideas, and social positions.  You can expect of me to foster an environment in which you can reach 
                    your academic goals.  I will expect of you, in-turn, to participate in that learning environment and contribute positively to 
                    other's learning.  Contributing positively to the learning environment means the following expectations (among others):
                </p>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Everyone is allowed to exist as themselves.  Harassing, dismissive, violent, disrespectful, or discriminatory 
                            rhetoric/behavior is not allowed.  You are allowed to be who you are.  Give that same freedom to others.  It is ok to 
                            disagree.  It is not ok make someone else feel less valuable.  I reserve the right to request students who engage in 
                            such behavior be removed from the course.  If you feel that something I have said in our class space does not support your 
                            right to be yourself, please let me know.
                        </p>

                            Let's do it.  Let's talk about AI.  No college course is about you turning some pieces of paper that say the right 
                            thing for college credit.  It is about learning what you need to succeed in your career, becoming an educated and 
                            compassionate citizen, and learning how to formulate your own ideas and communicate them effectively.  I am not 
                            opposed to you using AI <em>appropriately</em>.  Here is the general rule for this course: <em>AI should not be 
                            used to generate ideas.</em>  Use it to correct your grammar.  Use it to delve deeper into a topic you want to know 
                            more about.  Do NOT ask AI to write out a solution or submission for any assignment.  This includes <q>just using it to 
                            check an answer.</q>  Your submitted assignments should be a representation of how you connect with the material.  
                            Using AI inappropriately will be considered a violation of the University's Academic Honesty Policy.  If you have any 
                            questions about appropriate AI use, please let me know. 
                        </p>

                            I understand that life happens.  Sometimes, unexpected things require us to focus on other things.  I will keep this 
                            in mind regarding attendance and assignment submission.  However, I will expect honest, timely, and open communication.  
                            If a major event happens that may affect your ability to complete an assessment on time, let me know ahead of time so we can work something out.  Poor 
                            communication or ghosting the course are harder things to be flexible about.

                            Feel safe but avoid safetyism.  Safetyism is an obsession with eliminating or avoiding threats (even imaginary ones) 
                            to such an extent that you are unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs or accommodations necessitated by practical 
                            or moral concerns.  It is the belief that it is unhealthy to experience negative emotions.  In order to learn, you 
                            need to struggle a bit.  No one is a master of everything.  It's ok to feel confused.  It's ok to be disappointed.  
                            It's ok to think about things that are a bit uncomfortable.  A big part of this course will be reflecting on how you 
                            relate to money.  I'll tell you now, you're going to have a lot of negative emotions regarding finances over your 
                            life.  This course will help you prepare for those emotions, but you need to be willing to really think and explore 
                            your own mind.  Don't withdraw from challenge.  Don't hide from life.

                    Let's actually get started with personal finance.  Here is the thing.  Personal finance courses can be pretty ubiquitous.  
                    There are some things we'll definitely touch on, but you may have some particular questions about personal finance that 
                    you are hoping to explore in this course.  I'd like to include some of your questions, if possible.  So, your first activity

                    We all have different ways in which we relate to money.  Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all 
                    evil.  Some adore or worship money and wealth.  Some are very indifferent to money.

                We all have different ways in which we relate to money.  Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil.  
                Some adore or worship money and wealth.  Some are very indifferent to money.  No relationship to money is the <q>right</q> 
                one or the <q>wrong</q> one.  However, how you think about money absolutely influences your life, both day-to-day and long term.  
                Setting financial goals is important, but if you try to set goals while ignoring your connection to money, you are likely 
                setting yourself up for failure.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are going to take a short quiz.  There are no right answers.  There are <q>points</q> assigned to different options, but 
                <q>points</q> are not necessarily a good thing or bad thing.  For each question, do not answer as if anyone will look at these 
                because no one will.  Do not answer based on what you think is the most socially acceptable.  Really think about each question 
                and be comfortable selecting the answer that best describes you.  Please note that this is not an <q>official</q> test.  It is 
                just meant to get you to start thinking about your own connection to money.

                Below is a description, more or less, of the money personality types.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Money Worshipper.</term>
                A money worshipper often equates wealth with success or status.  They tend not to be shy or anxious regarding finances.  
                They believe that money is an important part of their connection to society.  A money worshipper can be either a saver or a 
                spender, but is usually a spender.  Positive traits of a money worshipper is that they may have the motivation to work harder 
                to accumulate wealth and may be more charitable.  Possible pitfalls of a money worshipper include over-spending, amassing 
                debt, having an unhealthy money fixation, and relationship stresses.  Being too much of a money worshipper may mean a belief 
                that accumulating wealth and status supersedes morality or ethics.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Money Avoider.</term>
                A money avoider tries to avoid thinking or talking about financial issues.  The topic of money can make them feel anxious.  
                Sometimes, a money avoider equates wealth with lower morals.  The potential benefits of being a money avoider can include 
                making ethical decisions without the influence of money.  Unfortunately, avoidance has many pitfalls including a 
                reluctance to budget or plan financially.  They may tend to over-rely on others for getting basic needs.  A money avoider 
                may also experience relationship stresses regarding finances.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Money Saver.</term>
                A money saver is more future-oriented and prefers to accumulate money to prepare for the future.  The benefits of 
                being a saver include understanding the importance of being financially-prepared, a willingness to budget, and being 
                prudent.  The potential pitfalls of being a money saver include becoming a miser or overly-cynical of spending.  They 
                may over-stress on finances and refuse to engage in practical spending.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Money Spender.</term>
                A money spender is more present-oriented and tends to use the money they have rather than save it for later.  
                The benefits of being a spender include being willing to engage in more self-care and being more open to a variety of 
                events or experiences that cost money.  Pitfalls include over-spending, lacking discipline to adhere to a budget, and 
                relationship stresses.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Money Indifferent.</term>
                Someone who is money indifferent does not feel excited or anxious about money.  People who are money indifferent 
                generally are either wealthy enough to never have to worry about money, or they have adopted an <q>out of sight - out of mind</q> 
                mentality.  Not many people truly fit into this category.  Most people get either anxious or excited about money, 
                but they may test into this category if they do not answer truthfully about certain scenarios.  Those truly indifferent to 
                money may have an easier time navigating relationships as money is less important to them.  However, they may also avoid 
                necessary financial planning.

                <term>Money Status.</term>
                A person who is both a money worshipper and money spender tend to focus on accumulating outward-facing symbols of 
                wealth.  They may prioritize buying an expensive car rather than investing their money.  They may work very diligently 
                to accumulate wealth.  However, they may take on too much risk and may make dangerous social comparisons.

                <term>Money Vigilant.</term>
                A person who is both a money avoider and money saver may be money vigilant.  Someone who is money vigilant can be 
                anxious or guarded around topics of personal finance.  Benefits include a willingness to save and budget, not overspending 
                on luxury items, and overall prudence.  Pitfalls can be becoming a miser or over-stressing about finances.

                <term>Money Monk.</term>
                A person who is both a money avoider and money spender may be a money monk.  Someone who is a money monk can feel 
                guilty when they have money.  They do not like talking about money, but they are willing to work for it.  They tend to 
                spend much of their money on others.  Benefits can include less stress in personal relationships and having a charitable 
                spirit.  Pitfalls include overspending and being unwilling to save for the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Money Hoarder.</term>
                A person who is both a money worshipper and money saver may be a money hoarder.  A money hoarder appreciates wealth and 
                equates it to status.  However, they do not outwardly display wealth to others.  The benefits of being a money hoarder is a 
                willingness to budget and save for the future.  Pitfalls can include refusing to spend on things important for their health 
                and having trouble navigating relationships.

                What should you take away from this activity?  As you explore personal finance and start planning for your present and 
                future, you need to work with yourself.  Working against yourself will make financial planning difficult and stressful.  
                For example, if you are a money spender and do not accept that part of your personality, saving and budgeting will be 
                much harder for you.  You may find yourself asking, <q>why can't I stop buying X?</q>.  If you can identify your relationship 
                to money, it will help you assess what you already do well and what you need to work on.
            </p>

            <p>
                You cannot change the entire world's connection to money.  You cannot change someone else's relationship to money.  
                You can only work on yourself.  By understanding how you think about and use money, you can become more mindful of all 
                the emotions that money can bring and be more prepared for them.  You want to make sound, prudent decisions about money 
                that will work toward your personal financial goals.  You need to truly know yourself to make these decisions.

            At the end of the day, financial well-being is large a product of the decisions we make with our money.  Knowing all 
            about the world of finance the consequences of decisions is not enough to maintain financial health.  You must also know why 
            you make the decisions you do.  Having an understanding of yourself will help you keep on making sound financial decisions and 
            avoid poor ones.

            <title>Money Personality</title>
            <p>
                You have seen a glimpse of money personality and have thought about your own.  Your money personality shapes your 
                beliefs and values regarding your finances (and even the whole financial world).  These beliefs and values directly 
                affect how you think about money.  For example, suppose you have $10,000 saved into an account.  A person who is a 
                saver will likely value security over spending and would be more inclined to continue saving or investing that money.  
                A money worshipper may value financial status and be more inclined to spend the money on something like a down payment for a 
                fancy car.  A money spender may value exciting experiences and see that money as an international vacation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The point is that it helps to know yourself around money.  Suppose you have that $10,000 and \textit{know} you shouldn't 
                spend it, but you find yourself unable to stop thinking about all you could buy with it.  Realizing that your money 
                personality may drive you more toward spending can allow you to be more mindful of your feelings.  Realize that your 
                feelings are not wrong.  Feel your feelings.  But go with what you know is the best option for you.  With practice, this 
                becomes easier and easier.

                    Everyone is unique, right?  Well, some aspects of money psychology are so common that there are names for them.  
                    In fact, many advertisements and salespeople utilize some of these aspects to manipulate you into spending your money.  
                    We'll discuss these tactics when we explore scams and manipulation.

                    Generally speaking, a <em>bias</em> is a thought, opinion, practice, etc. that is so imbedded in your brain that it 
                    affects your behavior without you realizing it.  A bias is not as simple as <q>I like X better than Y.</q>  They are subtle, 
                    but powerful.  Most people are unaware of their biases until those biases are confronted.  Even then, many people choose 
                    not to accept their own biases.  We will go through some of the most common financial biases.

                    Have you ever thought about needing the latest model of a phone, even though yours still works fine?  Is it the extra 
                    26 minutes of battery life?  Is it the extra 0.4MP resolution on the camera?  No.  It's about status.  Cellular phones and 
                    smartphones have been symbols of status since their creation.  (Seriously, look at who bought the first cellular phones in the 80's.)  
                    Status symbols can drive many of us to make purchases that stretch our budgets.  Many people buy the largest homes their 
                    budgets can possibly afford when a smaller one would be just as functional.  Many people dine at expensive restaurants 
                    mostly for the opportunity to post a photo of their meal to social media.  Similarly, some people buy the latest smartphones 
                    so that they can have the largest number available.

                    <term>Endowment Effect.</term>
                    The endowment effect is less about buying and more about selling.  Have you ever run a garage sale (or <q>tag sale</q> for 
                    you New Englanders) or tried to sell a car of phone?  That feeling you get when you are offered a price less than what 
                    you feel is owed is the endowment affect.  An interesting commonality in human psychology is that once we own an item we 
                    feel as though it is worth more.    
                </p>

                <figure>

            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                Imagine this scenario.  You buy a car that has a value of $25,000.  However, 
                the second you sign the paperwork and own the car, the car's value drops to $20,000 because the car now has a 
                <q>previous owner</q> and has depreciated.  How does that make you feel?  Are you feeling, <q>Oh, that totally makes sense 
                that my car is worth less</q>?  Or are you feeling, <q>That's bull.  If I haven't driven the car, it's still worth what I 
                paid for it</q>?  Probably the latter.  The thing with the endowment effect is that it can cause people to hold onto 
                items that they really want to sell.  Rather than earning some cash on an item you want to sell, you get no money and 
                need to keep owning your item.

                    <term>Loss Aversion.</term>
                    One of the workers behind the endowment affect is loss aversion, but loss aversion is a mental bias all its own.  
                    In general, people prefer to avoid losing money rather than making gains.  Don't believe me?  Think about this scenario.  
                    You can play a game.  You have a 75% chance of winning it.  If you win, you double your life savings.  If you lose, you 
                    lose all your life savings.  Do you play the game?  
                </p>

            <p>
                From a mathematical standpoint, the answer is clearly <q>yes!</q>  
                However, most people will not take that bet because of loss aversion.  Loss aversion has the potential to make you miss 
                out on financial opportunities and investment gains.  Now, a 25% chance of losing your life savings is a bit extreme, 
                but loss aversion can affect much <q>smaller</q> financial decisions.  Here's a common example with stocks.  When investors 
                see a good gain in a day, they are happy but not shocked.  However, when a loss of a similar magnitude happens, the feeling 
                of that loss hits much harder.  Many investors will then pull their money out of investments when they see a sudden loss.  
                However, selling a stock when it hits a low is generally not a good idea.  (On the other hand, some stocks will continue 
                to decline, and investors may choose not to sell due to loss aversion.)

                    <term>Anchoring Bias.</term>
                    Here is a <em>huge one</em> that is the foundation of a lot of advertising schemes.  
                    (We'll dig in more later as to how.)  Anchoring bias is now closely tied to the idea of a <q>sale</q> or <q>deal.</q>  
                    Seeing a product being offered for a price less than it was originally can make us want to buy that product, 
                    regardless of whether it is worth that much.   
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <caption>Source: https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/anchoring-bias</caption>

                </figure>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                Do you notice that <q>sale</q> tags <em>always</em> tell you the price 
                before the sale.  It's to trigger your anchoring bias.  There is a lot to discuss regarding manipulation and anchoring, 
                but that will come in a later unit.  For now, be aware that this bias exists.  When making decisions on what to buy, 
                do not concentrate on what was.  Concentrate on what is.  It doesn't matter that the pack of Oreos is usually 
                $4 and is $3 today.  Were you going to buy Oreos anyway?  Is $3 the price you're willing to pay? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, do not think that buying something that is on sale is anchoring bias and should be avoided.  
                That certainly isn't the case, and shopping sales can help with staying on a budget.
                Anchoring bias is wanted to buy something simply because it is marked on sale.
                If you regularly buy yarn because you are an avid knitter and wait until yarn is on sale to buy it is an example of better control of money.
                When you're out shopping for a new belt and see shirts are marked on sale and decide to now buy some shirts, that is likely anchoring bias influencing you.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Present Bias.</term>
                    It is usually easier to concentrate on what you're feeling now compared to what you may feel in the future.  
                    Present bias is the concept of living in the present.  Living in the present is great for mindfulness, 
                    but it can be detrimental to making future plans.  Living too much in the present can cause overspending on 
                    things you want now rather than saving for the future.  Of course, it isn't good to live totally in the future 
                    and become a miser.  Working with your present bias takes practice and hard work.  Your brain is hard-wired to 
                    want what you want now.  Delaying gratification for a much stronger sense of happiness takes conscious effort.  
                    Try to get into the habit of asking what you're giving up by spending money now.  By buying the latest model phone 
                    now instead of skipping a generation, what financial goals or milestones are you delaying?  By ordering that 
                    doughnut at Dunkin', what nutritional goals are you giving up?  You do not need to sacrifice everything that 
                    makes you happy, but you need to have an eye toward the future.  Your future self will thank you.

                    <term>Confirmation Bias.</term>
                    Have you ever scoured the Internet looking for opinions to help you make an important decision?  
                    Often, people find a scenario in which most of the information tells them not to make a certain choice, 
                    but they only really accept the small bit of information that supports making that choice.  This is 
                    confirmation bias at work. 
            </p>

            <sidebyside widths="40% 50%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">

                <p>
                    Here's an example (not really financial).  I am currently debating whether to get surgery on my spine to 
                    help with neurological pain.  I've been debating this surgery for three years.  When I have particularly bad 
                    flare-ups, I look for people's opinions and experiences with the surgeries.  I find myself much more likely to 
                    read stories of successes rather than warnings or bad experiences.  
                </p>
            </sidebyside>  

            <p>
                This is likely because that main pain has made 
                me unconsciously decide to get the surgery, and I am looking for confirmation of that opinion.  Confirmation bias 
                pops up constantly when making financial decisions.  If you find yourself looking at information and only clicking 
                on certain articles, posts, or sites, there is likely confirmation bias at work.  It is important to remain 
                objective as you make important decisions and accept all credible information as credible. 
            </p>  

            <p>
                Just as a point of reference.  Confirmation bias exists everywhere.  It is one of the cornerstones of racism, 
                conspiracy theories, homophobia, tribalism, etc.  It is a really, really strong bias that every person on this earth has.  
                Being more aware of it can help you make decisions that are actually in your own interest rather than making poor 
                decisions and mentally-manipulating what you see to confirm that poor decision.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Affinity Bias.</term>
                Related to confirmation bias is affinity bias.  Affinity bias can be thought of as brand loyalty that can cause some 
                inefficient financial decisions.  For example, many adults ignore cheaper store-brand items in grocery stores (or even 
                refuse to try shopping at a place like Aldi's); they instead only purchase items from brands they recognize.  Sometimes 
                there may be sound reasons for this restriction, but often the differences are minimal.  For example, many store brand 
                items are actually manufactured in the same factory as name-brand ones.  The only difference is packaging.

            <p>
                Affinity bias doesn't have to be objectively bad.  Many people make conscious efforts to support or not support certain 
                businesses or products.  For example, many people refuse to shop at Walmart, despite it being cheaper, because they do not 
                support the low wages paid to employees or the forced closures of small businesses.  What is important is for you to be 
                aware of affinity bias and make conscious choices that fit with your preferences and financial goals.

                    <term>Herd Mentality.</term>
                    Very much related to social bias is herd mentality.  You have likely heard of it before.  It's the thing 
                    everyone says people different from them follow and is what hipsters claim to be immune to.  We are all under the 
                    effect of herd mentality.  It's easy to see when other people are following a herd, particularly when we don't like that 
                    particular herd.  It is much harder seeing when you are following a herd.

                <p>
                    The consequences of herd mentality in the financial world (and beyond) are many.  Herd mentality can cause you to 
                    buy something you really don't need or even convince you that you do need an item.  It can cause investors to buy stocks 
                    that have been on the rise right before a <q>bubble burst.</q>  In the modern world, the two most prevalent sources of herd 
                    mentality are in rating systems and influencers.  Did you most recipe ratings online are fake?  Did you know most Amazon 
                    reviews on a product are not for the actual product you're interested in?  Yet they're important factors in determining 
                    our behavior.  Speaking as someone who grew up before social media, I cannot tell you how bonkers I find the idea of 
                    watching an influencer.  Yet followers beget more followers, which is the very concept of herd mentality.

                One thing to notice is that thinking about weaknesses in the way we think is difficult.  That's because of the biggest bias of

                However, like it or not, biases affect your behavior.  Some may be more prone to certain biases than others, but bias is part of the

            <p>
                Before we dive into setting good financial goals, I want you to physically write out at least two financial goals that 
                you have.  No restrictions.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-">
            <title>STAR Financial Goals</title>
            <p>
                Here is the thing about most financial goals.  They usually fail.  It's unfortunate, but true.  The reason for 
                failure usually isn't bad luck or an economic downturn.  Most financial goals are doomed from the start.  
                This is because most financial goals are vague and have no realistic plan behind them.  Maybe a financial 
                goal of yours is to be able to buy a house.  It is a nice enough goal, but it is vague with no plan.  When do you want 
                to buy the house?  How will you save up for it?  Is your plan realistic?
            </p>

            <p>
                A good financial goal need to have certain characteristics.  We'll use saving for a home as an example.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Specific.</term>
                A financial goal can't be vague.  It needs to be specific.  Suppose you would like to buy a house?  
                Depending on the size, location, and type of house you may want, the finances involved will vary wildly.  You'll 
                need a down payment, which can be (maybe possibly) as low as 3.5%, but preferably 20%, of the house's value.  
                Maybe the kind of home you're interested in will be worth about $300,000 by the time you buy it, and you want a 15% down 
                payment.  Then your more specific goal is, <q>I want save $45,000 as a down payment to buy a home.</q>  This goal is specific.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Timed.</term>
                Your financial goal should have timing to it.  In how long will you achieve your goal?  How often will you perform a 
                necessary action to work toward that goal?  If your goal is to save $45,000 for a down payment, then ask <q>when will 
                I have that $45,000?</q> and <q>how often will I put money aside for it?</q>  For example, you could say, <q>I want to save $45,000 
                to buy a home in ten years by saving $400 each month.</q>
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Achievable.</term>
                Your financial goal should be achievable.  That is, it should possible given your current financial situation.  
                Your goal should not bank on the hope that you will land a seven-figure job.  Setting a goal of owning a private island is 
                likely not achievable for anyone in this class without some huge inflow of resources.  (Did reading that sentence trigger 
                any emotions in you?  Make note, if so.)  You cannot simply say, <q>Well, I'll get a job that pays millions.</q>  You 
                need to be honest about your limitations.  The key question is, <q>What can you manage <em>right now</em>?</q>  Buying an island isn't 
                very likely or reasonable.  On the other hand, buying a home is achievable.  About two-thirds of Americans live in a 
                home owned by the occupants.  (Note that this is <em>not</em> saying that two-thirds of people or families own their homes!)  
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the goal of saving $400 each month for a house down payment.  The question is whether this goal is achievable 
                or not, given the person's current financial situation.  If not, the goal may need to be altered, or you may need to 
                change your current financial situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Realistic.</term>
                Similar to being achievable, financial goals need to be realistic.  Being realistic includes being abstractly achievable, but 
                it also includes making the saving process more tangible.  What I mean is that, for example, saving $400 each month may be 
                well within the realm of being possible or achievable.  However, realistically, how will you do it?  Perhaps, your goal 
                could be, <q>I want to save $45,000 for a down payment on a home in ten years by saving $200 from each of my biweekly 
                paychecks.</q>  Depending on your situation, this may or may not be realistic.  If not, can you change some numbers to make it 
                realistic?  Maybe the goal could be, <q>I want to save $50,000 for a down payment on a house in fifteen years by saving $135 
                from my biweekly paychecks.</q>
            </p>

                Now is your time to practice.  Come up with two financial goals that are specific, timed, achievable, and realistic.

                I want you to notice something about what you may be feeling after thinking about financial goals.  
                If you started thinking about what you can realistically do to save money, you likely started feeling stressed.  That is 
                okay.  In fact, setting financial goals is usually stressful.  However, stress is not always bad.  (Look up <q>eustress.</q>)  
                There are a couple reasons for this stress.
            </p>

            <sidebyside widths="50% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    First, a financial goal means you can't have what you want <em>now</em>, and that's tough in today's modern society.  
                    Everything can be delivered to your door in 2 days.  International trade allows for items to be manufactured at extremely 
                    low prices.  Our society is built around getting what we want immediately.  
                </p>

            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                It's stressful to confront the very real fact that you can't always get what you want right away (or ever in some cases).  
                (If you want some context for relatively-recent history of buying stuff, ask your parents or grandparents about ordering from 
                the Sears catalog.)  It is important that you learn to confront this stress.  The more you practice accepting that some goals 
                take time and effort to achieve, the better you will become at achieving them.  It's not a simple thing to do, but it does get 
                easier with practice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most financial goals require you to save.  Honestly, saving money stinks.  Saving money means you have less to spend, which 
                means you need to make some sacrifices in regards to what you buy.  For example, one long-term STAR goal I have is to save for 
                my retirement by putting aside the maximum allowed contribution (currently $7,000 a year) into my IRA by depositing $270 from 
                each of my bi-weekly paychecks.  It's a good goal, but that goal means I have about $540 each month that I can't spend.  
                Thinking about what I could do with an extra $7,000 each year is stressful.  However, with the right mindset and some 
                discipline, I accept that my financial goal takes priority over that extra spending money.  Here is one tip.  Do not think 
                of saving as a sacrifice.  If feasible, think of it as part of your regular budget - something that you need to do with 
                each paycheck.  Commit to it with a concrete plan and stick with it.  It doesn't take long until saving is a habit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Perhaps some of you began to actually worry about practically working toward your goals.  This may be a sign that your 
                goal isn't achievable or realistic.  When a goal requires you to save, the goal should be one that is within your power 
                to work toward.  If your goal is too lofty or requires too much financial compromising, you won't be able to stick to it.  
                Remember that it is always better to make slower, healthy progress than fast, unsustainable progress.  Burnout is very real.
            </p>

            <p>
                This debrief is not meant to make you feel stress.  It is to help you be mindful of any stress you may feel.  Stressing 
                over finances doesn't mean you're goals are bad, and it is okay to feel some stress over them.  Work with that stress to 
                formulate and follow STAR goals.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-example-wrong">
            <title>Example of a Goal Going Wrong</title>
            <p>
                I'll give you an example of when I set a financial goal that wasn't a STAR goal and how it ultimately failed.
            </p>

            <p>
                After I graduated from college and went to graduate school, I really started thinking about retirement.  I knew that 
                my IRA would be an important part of my retirement, and I knew that starting retirement savings early would pay 
                massive dividends later on.  So, I set the goal of putting aside the maximum allowed amount each year 
                (then $5,000) into my IRA.  That was my whole goal.  My goal was specific - it was well-defined and gave a particular 
                dollar amount.  However, it was not timed, achievable, or realistic.  It wasn't timed because I didn't think about how often I would 
                put money aside or how much.  It wasn't achievable because I was only making $20,000 per year pre-tax.  If I put $5,000 from my 
                paychecks aside, I would have only had $10,000-$11,000 <em>a year</em> for housing, food, clothing, utilities, etc.  
                Housing and utilities alone were about $8,000 a year.  (This was lower-middle class Indiana around 2008.)  It wasn't 
                realistic because I did not have a particular way to save money that I could actually stick to.
            </p>

            <p>
                You might think, <q>well, if he couldn't save $5,000 a year, he probably saved as much as he could.</q>  Nope.
            </p>

            <p>
                To reach my goal, I would have needed to set aside $193 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks, which I simply couldn't do.  
                My brain didn't go to, <q>>well, just save what you can.</q>  My brain went to, <q>I can't meet this goal with this paycheck.  
                So, I'll skip it and do it with the next one.</q>  Except I didn't.  I didn't ever.  I occasionally saved money in my 
                IRA - $100 here, $150 there.  By the end of my five years in graduate school, I don't think I saved more than $4,000.  
                That's way less than the $25,000 I wanted to save.  In hindsight, failing to meet my goals stressed me out.  It was 
                easier for me to basically mentally abandon that goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                What went wrong?  My goal was simply impossible with my financial situation at the time.  It wasn't a STAR goal.  I 
                set my sights too high.  My goal should have been, <q>I will save for retirement by depositing $100 from each of my 
                paychecks for the next five years.</q>  That I could have managed.  It wasn't my first choice of a goal, but it would 
                have been a STAR goal.  I could have gotten into a routine of saving that $100 from each check.  That would have 
                been $12,000-$13,000 saved by the time I graduated.  It doesn't sound like much of a difference from $4,000 in the grand 
                scheme of retiring, but believe me that it does make a huge difference.  (We'll explore why in later units.)
            </p>

            <p>
                What should you take from this?  Yes, setting financial goals takes work.  Yes, sticking to your goal paths takes even 
                more work.  But setting unreachable goals and failing to make any progress can be a nasty cycle.  A good goal can break you 
                out of those cycles.

                    The money personality quiz is by no means an official psychological test.
                    It is simply a tool to help you start thinking about how you tend to think about money.
                    The important thing is for you to be honest with yourself about your feelings with regards to finances.
                    You wouldn’t believe the level of mental gymnastics some people go through to rationalize unhealthy financial decisions.
                    Financial decisions are not intrinsically “good” or “bad.” We want to understand <em>why</em> we behave the way we do.

                <p>
                    At its most fundamental, financial literacy is about understanding financial decisions with your current and predicable financial situation.
                    It isn’t really about sudden expansions in your income stream.
                    Here is the thing about avenues in which some people have obtained vast wealth quickly: For every person who has achieved wealth in a particular way, there are thousands who have tried and failed, often due to luck.
                    Perhaps someone gambled heavily on a volatile stock and won.
                    There are tens of thousands who have tried a similar gamble and lost.
                    For every Internet personality who has gone viral, there are tens of thousands with equal or greater talents who have not gone viral.
                    This is all related to something called “survivorship bias.”

                    Honestly, I would not concentrate on that goal for the time being.
                    Some people may argue that an unattainable, lofty goal is good motivation, but I would argue that concentrating on something out of reach will create feelings of disappointment, despair, and frustration.
                    Instead, I would set a goal of expanding your income with the same STAR attributes.
                    Expanding your income may take quite a while, but there are routes to doing so.
                    Once you’re in a situation in which your lofty goal is achievable and realistic, then put your energy (and money) into it.

                    I just want to learn about finances.
                    What if I don’t care about the psychology stuff?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Life is complicated and difficult.
                    Actions have consequences.
                    I can tell you all the consequences of financial decisions, but that alone won’t turn you into a financial guru.
                    Let’s take smoking as an example.
                    You’ve been told from many different resources that smoking is an action with only negative consequences.
                    Why do some people never smoke once? Why do some people choose to try smoking? Why do some people get addicted? Those questions have different answers for each person.
                    It is the underlying psychology of each person that influence decisions.
                    Given the exact same information, no two people will have the exact same reaction or decision.
                    People can make some really unhealthy financial decisions with life-altering impacts.
                    I am hoping that with some self reflection, you will understand your own urges and impulses and make decisions that are well-informed.

                                    A couple is looking to renovate their kitchen and are soliciting bids from various contractors.  
                                    After receiving all the bids, one person in the couple says, <q>I know this contractor is willing to do 
                                    it for $5,000 less, but he was wearing a hat with ________________________on it.  I won't pay anyone

                                    A couple is arguing over whether to keep paying for an expensive storage unit rental.  One person

                                    just sell anything of value in the unit.  The other person argues,<q>I can't just sell that stuff.

                                    Grenda Byesalot walks into a Walmart to pick up some groceries.  While walking past the clothes section, 
                                    she notices a huge <q>Rollback</q> sign indicating that graphic t shirts are now $4 cheaper than they 
                                    usually are.  Grenda reasons that it would be silly not to buy a shirt now because they'll just 
                                    be more expensive later if she waits.

                        We targeted three learning objectives in this unit: life-long learning, metacognitive reflection, and social-emotional 
                        skills.  For each of the learning goals, write a few sentences as to how this unit's material has helped you progress 
                        toward meeting those learning objectives.  The three learning goal descriptions are as follows:

                                    Life-long learning: Students practice skills and attitudes central to lifelong learning; including a 
                                    growth mindset that encompasses self-reflection, flexibility, intellectual curiosity, and considers broad 
                                    perspectives and diversity of thought.

                                    Metacognitive reflection: Students reflect on their own wellbeing in the context of the course topic and 
                                    develop metacognitive reflection abilities that work to promote transfer of wellness behaviors and 
                                    skills.  (<q>Metacognitive</q> means thinking about your own though processes.)

                                    Social-emotional skills:  Students identify personal social, emotional, and cognitive skills to be 
                                    practiced and developed; including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, responsible 
                                    decision making, relationship skills, and communication skills.
