            Have you ever been in a situation where you are inclined to say, “What are the chances of this?!” The funny thing about coincidences is that they aren’t are unlikely as you think.
            One of the most important, but misunderstood, aspects of life is the nature of randomness and probability.
            In this section, we’ll be considering why unlikely coincidences and events aren’t really “unlikely.”

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Birthday-Problem">
            <title>The Birthday Problem</title>
            <p>
                One common coincidence that people experience is running into someone with the same birthday.
                Let’s briefly exam how common or uncommon this is.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose there are a number of people in a room.
                What is the probability that <em>at least two people</em> share a birthday?
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that this question is difference than, “what is the probability that someone has your birthday?” We are just asking if there are some people in the group that share a birthday.
                It turns our that this question is more easily answered by asking the opposite question.
                Instead we ask, “what is the probability that <em>no one</em> shares a birthday with anyone else?” The reason why is it is easier to examine this question mathematically.
            </p>

            <p>
                We won’t go over the mathematics in full, but we’ll explore a bit.
                Let’s suppose that 3 people come into a room one-by-one.
                Let’s also suppose (for simplicity) that February 29th birthdays aren’t a thing and that birthdays are evenly distributed over a whole year.
                The first person walks into the room followed by the second.
                What is the probability that person number 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1? It is <m>\frac{364}{365}\approx 99.73\%</m>.
                Now the third person walks in.
                What is the probability that that person does not share a birthday with either person 1 or person 2? It would be <m>\frac{363}{365}\approx 99.45\%</m>.
                (Because there are 363 other days in the year that are not the birthdays of persons 1 or 2.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Now here is the important bit.
                What is the probability that all three have different birthdays? We calculate it as a process.
                First, person 2 has a different birthday than person 1.
                Then, person 3 has a different birthday than person 2.
                The probability is calculated as the product of those two events: <m>\frac{364}{365}\times \frac{363}{365}\approx 99.12\%</m>.
                So, it’s very likely that the three people have different birthdays.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now what if we increase the number of people? If we add a fourth person, the probability that none of the four people share a birthday with someone else in the group is: <m>\frac{364}{365}\times \frac{363}{365}\times\frac{362}{365}\approx 98.36\%</m>.
                So, if there is a group of four people, there is a <m>100\% - 98.36\% = 1.64\%</m> chance that at least two people share a birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can keep going:
            </p>

            <p>
                5 people in a group: 2.71%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                6 people in a group: 4.05%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                7 people in a group: 5.62%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                8 people in a group: 7.43%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that the chances of a shared birthday is growing with the number of people.
                Also notice that the chance is growing faster and faster.
                This is the important observation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, if you have 23 people in the group, if you do the math, you’ll get that there is a 50.73%chance that there is a shared birthday in a group.
                That means that when there are 23 people in a group, it is actually more likely that at least two people share a birthday than it is that everyone has different birthdays! (This does <alert>not</alert> means that it is more likely that someone has <em>your</em> birthday than not.
                It means that it is more likely that there are some people who share a birthday.) That mathematical fact is not obvious, bit it is important.
                If you were sitting in a class with at least 23 students, do you intuitively believe that it is likely that some people in the room share a birthday? Probably not, but it is true.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Probability-Something-Happens">
            <title>The Probability-that-Something-Happens</title>
            <p>
                Here is the important takeaway from the birthday problem.
                It is indeed unlikely that when two people meet that they have the same birthday.
                However, when there is a group of people, there are a lot of “chances” for there to be a shared birthday.
                With each person, the likelihood that no one has a shared birthday gets smaller and smaller, making the likelihood of some shared birthday higher and higher.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s consider another type of problem.
                Suppose the WSU SGA is holding an event in which there are three games to play.
                For each game, only 20%of people win.
                How likely is it that you win at least one of the games?
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, it is mathematically easier to find the probability that you do not win <em>any</em> of the games.
                For each game, there is an 80%chance that you’ll lose.
                The probability that you lose all three would be <m>0.8 \time 0.8 \time 0.8 = 0.512</m> or 51.2%.
                This means there is a 48.8%chance that you’ll win at least once.
                Were you expecting that probability to be that high?
            </p>

            <p>
                What we are doing here is not looking at one event happening on its own.
                Instead, we are looking at all possible events at once and asking what is the likelihood that at least one of the possible things happen.
                Or rather, what is the likelihood that none of the events happen? Or even, what is the likelihood that no coincidences happen? The more possibilities for <em>some</em> coincidence to happen, the more likely that something will happen.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Why-It-Matters">
            <title>Why It Matters</title>
            <p>
                Here is some good news.
                You probably will not die from heart disease.
                About 20.1%of Americans die from heart disease, which means 79.9%do not.
                You probably won’t die from cancer.
                About 19%of Americans will die from cancer.
                So, about 81%of Americans do not die from cancer.
                You probably won’t die from an unintentional injury like falling or getting in a car accident.
                About 7%of Americans die from accidents, which means 93%of Americans do not die from accidents.
                You probably won’t die from a stroke.
                About 5.3%of American die from a stroke, meaning 94.7%of Americans do not.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the bad news.
                If we ask, what is the probability that you won’t die from heart disease, cancer, an accident, or a stroke, the probability because <m>0.799 \times 0.81 \time 0.93 \time 0.947 \approx 0.57</m> or 57%.
                This means there is a 43%chance that you will die from one of those causes, which is very high.
                To make matters worse, if you are wondering what the probability is of simply passing on in your sleep without disease or disfunction, it’s really, really small.
                (Please note that there are a lot of other factors that contribute to these proababilities.
                So, these figures likely do not apply exactly to you individually.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the point to take away.
                Individually, the likelihood of one particular thing happening may be small.
                However, the probability that at least one bad thing happening gets quite large.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is all about risk exposure.
                Take today as an example.
                Today, it is very unlikely that you’ll experience something that will require you to get emergency medical care (poisoning, injury, disease, etc.) Tomorrow, it will be just as unlikely.
                But what about <em>some</em> day in the next year? The likelihood that you will need emergency medical care at some point in the next year is substantially higher than the likelihood that you will need it on one particular day.

        <title>Insurance</title>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-What-Is-Insurance">
            <title>What Is Insurance?</title>
            <p>
                We’ve already examined one big insurance program: Social Security.
                We’ve never discussed what insurance actually is.
                Insurance is an agreement of sorts.
                Someone who is exposed to a certain risk of something bad happening may want the security of being able to survive or afford getting through that bad thing, should it happen.
                Suppose, for example, someone is concerned that their car may be stolen one day.
                They may want some kind of protection financially should their care actually get stolen.
                Insurance is a way for this security to happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                A person or company may be willing the help someone get through a certain negative experience in exchange for money.
                That is, for example, perhaps some company is willing to reimburse the person if their car were actually stolen.
                The risk of a stolen car gets moved from the person to the company.
                The company would not take on this risk for free though.
                The person would need to pay the company compensation for taking on the risk.
                This is essentially how insurance works at its most basic.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-Insurance-Works">
            <title>How Insurance Works</title>
            <p>
                When you are concerned about the possibility of a bad event (getting injured, your car gets damaged, your house burns down, etc.), you may want to protect yourself financially from these events.
                For example, maybe you want to protect yourself from needing to pay a medical bill or needing to fix your car or needing to rebuild your house.
                For many of these possible bad events, an <alert>insurance provider</alert> may be willing to take on your financial obligations should something bad occur in exchange for compensation.
                This financial compensation is usually through regular payments called <alert>premiums</alert>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s take a house as an example.
                Suppose that you own a house that would cost $300,000 to rebuild or replace.
                You likely don’t have that money and wouldn’t be able to take out another loan to rebuild your house, should something happen.
                You could protect yourself from that scenario by setting up an <alert>insurance policy</alert> with a provider.
                They may charge you something in the range of $500-$900 for a premium per month to take on the finances of rebuilding your home.
                That sounds like a lot of money to pay each month, but it depends on how much you value protection.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have a policy in place, you are <alert>covered</alert> by your insurance provider in the event that a <alert>covered</alert> event happens.
                For example, more house insurance policy will cover damage from accidental fire, but they won’t cover fire damage if you purposely set your house on fire.
                When a covered event happens, you get in contact with your insurance company to <alert>file a claim</alert>.
                Over a bit of time, the insurance company will either give you a check for you to use to pay for bills and other expenses related to the event or pay the various service providers directly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Theoretically, any “bad” event in life could be covered by some insurance policy.
                The big ones are medical issues, automobile issues, building issues, early death, and property loss.
                However, you can get insurance on things like weather delaying your plane flight, alien abductions, and someone not showing up to their wedding.
            </p>

            <p>
                The important thing about insurance is that you need to have a policy with a provider <alert>before</alert> a bad event happens, never after.
                In some respects, insurance is a form of cost sharing.
                Multiple people pay premiums for their insurance coverage, and those premiums are used to pay for any covered losses or events that anyone in that pool experiences.
                However, to get the benefits of this cost sharing, you need to contribution your own premiums before something bad happens.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Mandatory-Insurance">
            <title>Mandatory Insurance</title>
            <p>
                In some instances, whether or not you want to take on the risk of paying for a bad event, you may be required legally to carry certain insurance policies.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you own a car in Massachusetts and want to legally drive it, you are required to carry a certain kind of insurance.
                If you are responsible for a car accident, you would be required to pay for repairing or replacing the other person’s car.
                You will also likely have some injury, and you would be responsible for paying for those medical expenses (up to a certain amount).
                You are required to carry insurance that would cover those expenses.
                This required insurance can make owning a car really expensive.
                The rationale for this requirement is that most people cannot pay for the expenses relating to an accident when they cause one.
                It is also expensive and difficult for the victim in the accident to get any sort of payment from the “at-fault” driver.
                While it may seem like this required insurance is an unnecessary expense that protects others, as a whole group, you are just as protected with every else’s insurance policies.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you take out a loan to purchase something, often a house or car, the lending bank will almost certainly require you to carry insurance that will completely replace the thing should anything happen.
                So, if you want to take out a mortgage for a house, you’ll be required to carry insurance on the house.
                If you take out a loan for a car, you’ll need to carry additional insurance that will replace or repair your car should it get damaged or stolen.
                The purpose here is for lenders to protect the collateral on the loans.
                The items you buy with the loaned money serve has collateral for the loan.
                The bank wants to maintain that collateral.
                Again, it appears that this kind of insurance is something to benefit the banks and not you.
                Keep in mind that if this requirement were not part of loans, the loans themselves would be much more expensive each month.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Affordable Care Act brings a requirement that every citizen have a certain level of “coverage” for medical expenses.
                The actual requirements are long and complicated, but just understand that every citizen is required to have some level of medial insurance.
                The penalty for not having adequate coverage is a tax penalty.
                However, it is easy to avoid this penalty by stating that you have a religious exemption to insurance coverage.
                One of the main rationales for this law is to make everyone part of the “cost sharing” in medical insurance.
                Again, it’s the situation in which if you only think of your medical issues in isolation or a vacuum, the requirement seems like a punishment, but if you consider the financial effects through cost sharing, you can see the benefit you get.

    <section xml:id="sec-Properties-of-Insurance">
        <title>Properties of Insurance</title>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, insurance is rarely as easy as buy policy, have accident, get accident paid for.
            There are a number of different characteristics to policies that affect how money is exchanged.
            We’ll go over the most common ones.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Deductibles">
            <title>Deductibles</title>
            <p>
                If your insurance policy has a <alert>deducible</alert>, it means that the insurance provider will only pay for a bad event after you’ve paid a certain amount.
                For example, suppose you have a medical policy in which there is a $1,000 deductible applied each year.
                This means that before the medical insurance will pay for any of your medical expenses, you’ll need to pay $1,000 of your own money first.
                For example, suppose your medical insurance has a $1,000 deductible.
                Suppose that you get sick and need to visit your doctor, who charges $300 per visit.
                You would pay that $300.
                Now suppose that sometime later you fall and break your leg.
                The process of getting x-rays and a cast cost $4,000.
                You would pay the first $700 since that is the remaining balance on your deductible.
                insurance would cover the rest.
                All other expenses will be covered by insurance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that in the above scenario, you wouldn’t like need to pay that first $300.
                Due to the Affordable Care Act, things like visits to a doctor can be held liable to deductibles.
                However, the idea outlined above is how deductibles work mathematically.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, why do deductibles exist? The benefit to you are lower monthly premiums.
                Deductibles mean less risk for the insurance company, which means they’ll require less in premiums each month to take on the risks.
                It also has to do with the cost to process claims.
                Suppose you notice that your car has a really feint surface scratch on it that you could easily buff out for about $10.
                If you had an insurance policy for your car with no deductible, you could choose to take your car to an autobody shop to have the scratch repaired and have insurance pay for it.
                Not only would they need to pay the autobody shop (likely around $200), they also need to pay the employees who actually handle claims like this.
                It’s expensive.
                So, such an insurance policy would require much higher premiums compared to one with a deductible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deductibles aren’t mandatory.
                Many insurance companies have policies with no deductibles.
                You might be shocked at how much more expensive no-deductible policies are.
            </p>

            <p>
                Co-pays are similar to deductibles.
                They are most commonly found in medical-related insurances.
                When you visit a medical office, you may have to pay a <alert>co-pay</alert>.
                This is a relatively-small amount that you pay for a medical visit, and your insurance would pay for the rest.
                For example, if your doctor charges $300 per visit and you have a $20 co-pay, when you visit your doctor, you would need to pay $20 to them directly, and your insurance would pay the remaining $280.
            </p>

            <p>
                Co-pays are often the most common expenses people pay for medical care in the US.
                So, they are often viewed negatively.
                Much like deductibles, the purpose of co-pays is to reduce the monthly premiums people pay.
                Essentially, co-pays deter people from visiting a doctor for non-emergency situations.
                For example, if someone were to wake up with a minor sore throat, they may be inclined to visit the doctor to determine if it is strep throat or some other unlikely illness.
                However, a copay may make that person reconsider going until they have more pronounced symptoms.
                The benefit of this determent is that medical costs as a whole are much lower and alleviates the strain of having too few doctors.
                The potential issue with co-pays is that some people may not seek medical care when it is actually necessary.

            <title>Policy Limits</title>

            <p>
                Some insurance policies have a maximum amount they will pay for a loss, injury, etc.
                This is called a <alert>policy limit</alert>.
                Policy limits are very common in car insurance and property insurance.
                Limits are not necessary, and the limit amount direct affects your monthly premium.
                The lower your policy limit, the lower your monthly premium.
                Suppose you insure your car that is worth $30,000 with a policy limit of $20,000.
                If your car is completely destroyed, your insurance would cover only $20,000.
                You’d pay the remaining $10,000.

        <title>Health Insurance</title>
        <p>
            Let's consider the most common forms of insurance in the US.  We'll start with health/medical insurance.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Single-Payor-vs-Private">
            <title>Single-Payor vs. Private</title>
            <p>
                As you are probably aware, medical (health) insurance in the US is a bit messy.
                We have a much different system than most developed countries.
                Most developed countries have form of “single-payor” medical coverage.
                In such a system, most medical expenses are paid for by government funds, which is in turn funded through taxes.
                There are exceptions to what is paid for and what is not, but that is basics of a single-payor system.
                There are still medical insurance companies in these countries, who provided “supplementary” insurance on any medical care, supplies, or procedures that are not covered in the basic system.
            </p>

            <p>
                The US does not have a single-payor system.
                We have a “private” system.
                In such a system, medical care is not guaranteed and citizens are responsible for paying for their own medical care.
                To help pay for medical expenses, people can get medical insurance to cover many of those expenses.
                There are certain forms of government-funded medical coverage.
                For example, Medicaid is a program in the US that provides basic medical bill coverage for certain people (pregnant women, low-income citizens, the elderly, people with disabilities).
                It is funded via Social Security and taxes.
                Most people have basic medical coverage via Medicare when they reach age 65.
                For most, Medicare is mandatory.
                Both Medicaid and Medicare cover very basic medical procedures, visits, prescriptions.
                Most people find they need to pay for “supplementary coverage” for many medical issues.
                Some states have their own medical programs.
                Massachusetts has Mass Health, which provides medical coverage for children, low-income individuals, etc.).
                It usually provides more medical coverage than Medicaid.

            <title>Employer-Sposored Health Insurance</title>
            <p>
                Private medical insurance can be paid for individually or as a group.
                Many employers offer to pay for some or all of an employee’s medical insurance premiums as part of their compensation package.
                However, these employers usually pay for a group insurance, meaning that employees do not pick their own plan and go with what is offered through group insurance.
                Most commonly, employers will pay for 75-80%of insurance premiums.
                If you do not have subsidized insurance through your employer and do not have government-funded coverage, you would pay for medical insurance on your own.
                Generally, employer-sponsored medical insurance can cover the employee’s spouse and children as well (up until age 26) for an increased premium.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Issue-of-Coverage">
            <title>The Issue of Coverage</title>
            <p>
                Medical insurance is expensive.
                Like, really expensive.
                Medical insurance premiums are about on par with what people pay for housing.
                The worst thing is that, as people age, the need for medical insurance drastically increases.
                Some people even delay retirement because they do not want to lose their subsidize medical insurance.
                There are a variety of factors that control medical insurance premiums, including rising costs of medical procedures, hospital and insurance company executive greed, people living longer, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                No matter the form of health insurance someone has, there is an issue of coverage.
                You medical insurance policy dictates what medical-related expenses are covered.
                Often, insurance plans will only cover the most financially-efficient option.
                For example, suppose you need a particular surgery.
                There is an older, more risky surgery that has been done for 50 years.
                There is also a newer, safer surgery that is more expensive.
                Based on a number of factors, your insurance may refuse to cover that newer, safer surgery if they deem the older one more financially prudent long-term.
                Particularly in countries with private medical insurance, people often worry about whether the medical care they need will be covered by their insurance plan or not.
                Sometimes, it is a huge surprise to people when they find out after receiving medical care that their care wasn’t covered by insurance and are stuck with a massive medical bill.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Other-Issue-of-Coverage">
            <title>The Other Issue of Coverage</title>
            <p>
                Here is one thing most people don’t know about medical bills.
                Medical bills can be negotiated.
                Insurance companies are very good at negotiating medical expenses.
                So, if you are given a copy of your medical bill, you may notice that the “amount billed” and “amount paid by insurance” are quite different.
                Generally, medical insurance companies have a maximum amount they will pay for certain medical procedures, supplies, prescriptions, etc.
                Medical provider may be willing to accept the negotiated amount.
                However, some providers will not accept the amount offered by insurance companies.
                In such a case, medical providers may refuse to “accept” your medical insurance, meaning that you cannot get medical care from that provider unless you pay for everything yourself, without insurance.
                Usually, medical providers will have a list of insurances they won’t accept or they will check prior to giving you medical care.
                So, it shouldn’t be a surprise that a provider doesn’t accept your insurance.
                This issue is particularly relevant for people on Medicare or Medicaid; many provider do not accept them.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may see the term “in-network.” This essentially means that the medical provider has made a long-term agreement with your insurance company to accept the negotiated rates they pay.
                Some insurances only pay for “in-network” providers.
                Some will pay for “out-of-network” providers, but will make you pay higher co-pays.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Choosing-Health-Insurance">
            <title>Choosing Health Insurance</title>
            <p>
                Whether you self-fund health insurance or get it through your employer, you are likely to have a choice in some of the details of your health insurance plan.
                In fact, some people choose employers based on what insurance they subsidize.
                Most people consider the following: premium amount, deductible amounts, co-pay amounts, and network area.
                Plans with higher deductibles and co-pays and smaller networks will have lower monthly premiums.
                Plans with lower deductibles and co-pays and larger networks will have higher deductibles.
                What is right for you varies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Younger, healthier individuals often are okay taking the risk of plans with higher deductibles and co-pays, taking the position that they are less likely to need expensive medical coverage.
                Older, more fragile individuals often prefer lower-deductible plans as they are more likely to need more frequent or more intensive medical care.
                There is no right answer.
                It depends on your income, risk tolerance, and personal/family health status.

            <title>The Basics</title>
            <p>
                Life insurance is an insurance that pays money upon someone’s death.
                The idea is that when a particular person dies, it can create financial hardship on someone else.
                For example, when someone dies, it will likely put financial hardship on their spouse who now has to fund all bills themselves.
                Most commonly, people purchase life insurance on <em>their own</em> death with a family member as the <alert>beneficiary</alert> of the money paid by the insurance company.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some employers offer subsidized life insurance for employees, which pays some number of years’ worth of their salary to the beneficially.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Costs">
            <title>The Costs</title>
            <p>
                Life insurance premiums vary wildly from person to person.
                Consider a 20-year-old person with a healthy lifestyle and a 90-year-old person who chain smokes and has chronic heart issues.
                One is more likely to die this year than the other.
                So, the premium for one will be higher than the other.
                Life insurance can be as cheap as $1 per month or up to thousands of dollars per month.
                There are a number of factors that contribute to life insurance costs.
                Your age, how much you want paid to your beneficiary, whether you smoke, your overall health, where you live, where you work, how far you commute to work, your hobbies, etc.
                There are some other demographics like gender, race, etc.
                that may or may not play a factor, depending on state law.

            <title>The Flavors of Health Insurance</title>
            <p>
                The most common form of life insurance is <alert>term life insurance</alert>.
                Term life insurance is life insurance that you can have up to a certain age.
                If you die before that age, your beneficiary gets the agree money.
                If you reach that age without dying, your policy ends.
                Term life insurance is much cheaper than other whole-insurance options, which makes them more popular.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whole life insurance is insurance with no age expiration.
                You are guaranteed coverages throughout your whole life.
                The downside of whole life insurance is that it is much more expensive.
                There is a common problem with the whole life insurance industry in that it can be predatory.
                Life insurance companies often target elderly people without life insurance with advertisements for whole life insurance, which is extremely expensive for the elderly.
                Commercials often center around scaring elderly folk into putting the cost of their death and funeral on loved ones.
            </p>

            <p>
                Life insurance can even cover loss of quality of life.
                There are plans that will pay you if you experience certain life-limiting issues.
                There are plans that will pay for assisted-living care in old age, if certain health conditions are met.
                There are policies that have a savings element to them.
                The industry is very broad and complex.
                The ins and outs are way beyond the scope of this course.
                For now, just know the basic forms of life insurance.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Types-of-Coverage">
            <title>Types of Coverage</title>
            <p>
                Car insurance should be simple, but it can be really complicated.
                Car insurance can protect your car, you, passengers, and other drivers in case you are in an accident or anything happens to your car.
                In its most basic, there are three components that can come with car insurance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Liability coverage will cover you in some aspects if you cause damage while driving.
                In Massachusetts, your liability coverage will pay for <em>your</em> medical bills if you are in an accident.
                It will also cover the property damage to the <em>other</em> car if <em>you</em> cause an accident.
                (In “at-fault” states, liability will instead pay for the other driver’s medical expenses if you cause an accident.) In terms of medical expenses, liability coverage will only pay a certain amount (usually up to $8,000, but sometimes only $2,000).
                Your medical insurance would cover the rest.
                In terms of property damage to the other car, the amount they would cover is also capped.
                (In most states, the minimum cap is $25,000, but you can get more coverage.) You would be legally liable for any property damage over this cap (which is sometimes covered by your house insurance.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Comprehensive insurance will cover your care for non-collision-related damage.
                Things like theft, scratches or dents from someone opening not being careful around your car, etc.
                This insurance is usually quite cheap, but it often has high deductibles ($500-$2,000).
            </p>

            <p>
                Collision insurance will cover the cost of repairing or replacing your car if you cause an accident.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally, liability coverage is required by states in order to operate a car.
                This is definitely true in Massachusetts.
                Comprehensive and collision coverage are usually required by banks if you take out a loan for your car.
                If you no longer make payments to the bank, comprehensive and collision coverage are optional.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Totalling-a-Car">
            <title>Totalling a Car</title>
            <p>
                One nasty thing about auto insurance is the idea of “totaling.” Suppose you have an older car that is only worth $2,000 and you are in an accident.
                If it would cost more than $2,000 to repair your car, the insurance company will “total” your car.
                In this case, they would give you a $2,000 check and wish you the best of luck in finding a replacement car for that much.
                Totaling rarely works out in favor of the car owner, and many people need to seek legal advice when offered a check instead of a car repair.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Price-Factors">
            <title>Price Factors</title>
            <p>
                How much you pay in monthly car insurance payments depends on a number of factors.
                You driving history, age, car model, where you live, how far you commute, your grades in high school, and whether you went to driving school are common factors.
                (The grades thing is generally for teen drivers only.) In some states, gender can be used as a factor as well.

            <p>
                Most people who one a home have insurance on the house.
                In fact, if you have a mortgage out on your house, you will be required to have housing insurance.
                At its most basic, home insurance will pay to repair or replace your house if anything were to happen to it.
                There are other components to it.
                Many plans will pay your legal expenses if someone where to get hurt on your property.
                Some plans will pay for anything you may owe in property damage you cause in a car accident.
                Most plans cover the cost to replace stolen or damaged items in you house.
                Home insurance can have a number of little tweaks to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                One issue with house insurance is the cost.
                Most insurers will only provide “full coverage,” meaning that you can only take out policies that will fully replace or repair your house in case of any issues.
                Many people would prefer to have only partial coverage, meaning that only amounts up to a certain set amount would be covered.
                The reason for this preference is that most damage to a house costs less than the house’s value to repair.
                For example, if you have a $300,000 house and you set your kitchen on fire, you won’t need $300,000 to replace the kitchen.
                However, most house insurance plans make you have one that will repair or replace the full amount if needed, which increases the monthly premiums.
                The reason why is complicated and multifaceted.
                It has to do with cost sharing and “anti-selection.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Renters insurance is like a lighter form of house insurance.
                Since you don’t own the building you rent, you do not need coverage to repair or replace the building.
                However, renters insurance can protect the belongings in your rented space or can even help pay to get you into a new place if something happens to the one you’re renting.
            </p>

                Sometimes, people become injured and cannot work for a while.
                You can carry <alert>disability insurance</alert> that will help replace your income if you become unable to do your job.
                Often, you can get disability insurance at a subsidized rate through your employer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of the temptation (and frequency) for people to go on disability insurance (due to people essentially wanting a break from work or early retirement), there are a number of caveats to disability insurance.
                First, most plans only cover up to 50-70%of your take-home pay.
                This reduced amount is to encourage people to start working again when they recover.
                Most plans have a “waiting period,” which means there is a time frame (usually two weeks to three months) in which the insurance company will not make you payments until you’re beyond the waiting period.
                Waiting periods are meant to deter people from going on disability unless necessary.
                Many plans will only make payments for a certain amount of time after your injury (often three months to two years).
                This is again meant to encourage people to return to work when able.

                <alert>Long-Term Care Insurance</alert> is like a long-term disability insurance. It is insurance that will either replace some of your income or pay for expenses when you are unable to work for longer periods of time. Long-term care coverage usually requires you to have more serious issues that limit your ability to function day-to-day such as not being able dress yourself or feed yourself. Long-term care can also cover living expenses in assisted living housing or nursing homes.

                    <p>
                        Suppose that you have two job opportunities.  
                        The first employer will hire you as a sub-contractor, meaning that they will not offer you any health insurance subsidization.
                        The employer will pay you $35 per hour at 40 hours of work per week.
                        The second employer will hire you as a full-time employee and offers health insurance subsidization.
                        The employer will pay 75% of your health insurance costs.
                        The employer pays $31 per hour at 40 hours of work per week.
                        Suppose that health insurance premiums are about $1,000 per month.
