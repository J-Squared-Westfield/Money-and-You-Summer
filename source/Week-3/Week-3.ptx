        <title>Budgeting Tools</title>
        <p>
            Budgeting doesn't have to be with just a notepad and a pencil.  There are some great resources to help create a clean and understandable budget.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-paper-tools">
            <title>Paper Tools</title>
            <p>
                For many people, the act of physically writing something can make it more concrete and real.
                If you are one of those people, doing your budget on paper may be the way to go.
                At the end of this section, I’ve included a possible monthly budget worksheet that I’ve created.
                It is one of many possible templates out there.
                Feel free to print it out if you’d like.
            </p>

            <p>
                A paper budget is fairly easy in concept.
                In the respective areas, write down your usual expenses in a month.
                Don’t include infrequent things like getting a tire repaired.
                Of course, you can include a “miscellaneous” in either needs or wants (or both).
                Ultimately, you need to make sure that your expenses, including savings, are no more than your total income for a month.
                If they are higher, you immediately know that you need to examine your expenses and make some changes.
                Once you’ve made sure you can afford your proposed month, you should make sure your budget falls in line with your savings goals.
                Whether it be the 20% or something different, ask yourself if you’re putting enough away for what you want to achieve.
                If not, you may need to make some changes to get your savings component higher.
            </p>

            <p>
                The downside to a paper budget is that they are not very secure and it is harder to keep a record of them.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-spreadsheets">
            <title>Spreadsheets</title>
            <p>
                As more people brought personal computers into their homes, budgeting on spreadsheets became very common.
                Any spreadsheet program works.
                There are even some programs available targeted specifically for budgeting, usually at a cost.
                I’m using “program” here rather than “app” to include hard-drive bound applications and locally-saved files.
                I understand that the term “program” is falling out of use.
                I am partial to Excel as my program of choice, which you can download for free as a Westfield State student.
            </p>

            <p>
                The nice thing about spreadsheets is that you can “program” them to automatically add-up totals, find percentages, or find differences (among other things).
                You can also simply type in numbers and calculate what you need to by hand.
                Ultimately, the process is the same as if you were working on paper.
                One big benefit is that you can download a spreadsheet file of all your purchases in a month from your credit card account or withdrawals from your bank account and paste them right into your spreadsheet.
                If you browse Reddit for a while, you’ll find most long-term budget users use spreadsheets over a fancy app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The downside of spreadsheet programs is the learning curve to some of them.
                You may need a working knowledge of your program of choice before you can really use them.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have uploaded two files on Plato for you to look at.
                One is a blank budget template that you free to use.
                The other is a simple example what a budget could look like.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-apps">
            <title>Apps</title>
            <p>
                The popularity of budgeting apps has been skyrocketing over the past number of years.
                They can be as simple or complex as you like.
                Some even connect to your bank, credit cards, and utilities accounts to automatically update values and make recommendations.
                One benefit to an app is that for people who do not have the discipline to stick with a spreadsheet month-to-month, an app can make the process more inviting, colorful, and efficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before progressing, a word of caution.
                As with everything in our connected world, access to services usually comes with security issues.
                Different apps collect different amounts of your private information.
                Before downloading any app or connecting something to one of your accounts, do some research into what information is collected and how it is stored and used.
                Only use a service in which you are comfortable with its information policies.
                Below, I give a couple of examples of popular budgeting apps.
                I don’t have a recommendation, and I do not make any claims to their information security policies.
                This is all informational stuff.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is another word of warning, and a life lesson.
                You’ll notice that most popular budgeting apps are not free, or they have very limited free versions that are barely useful.
                You’ll also see a price tag well beyond what they’re worth.
                (As in $10-$20 a month.) Here is why.
                The target audience of these apps are people who either are new to personal finance or have a history of poor budgeting habits.
                These companies are hoping to capitalize on this inexperience or lack of confidence.
                You have to ask yourself if the polish and extra features of a paid app are worth $100-$200 a year for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Goodbudget.
                Goodbudget uses the envelope method of budgeting.
                There is a “free” version that limits you to 10 “envelopes” (plus 10 miscellaneous envelopes) and does not connect to your bank.
                The paid version is either $10 a month or $80 a year.
                Essentially, you tell Goodbudget how much your paychecks are.
                You then set up virtual “envelopes” to allocate money.
                You can also tell it how much debt you have and how you are paying it off (like car loans or credit cards).
                Goodbudget is more about planning for your next month than it is reflecting on your past expenses.
                So, if you are looking for insight on why last month’s budget went awry, Goodbudget may not be the best option.
                The app also has no way of telling when you overspend from an envelope.
                If you budgeted $250 for groceries but spent $300, you’ll need to update that manually.
                If you need some help planning and have the discipline to manually enter and keep track of your expenses, Goodbudget may work.
            </p>

            <p>
                -YNAB.
                (Used to be “You Need A Budget.” Not it’s “Why-Nab.”) YNAB might be the most polished, and expensive, app available.
                It is $15 per month or $110 per year.
                Much of your money goes toward the polish, but that is important for some people.
                YNAB connects to most bank accounts.
                If you use your debit card or direct pay for most expenses, YNAB can automatically determine what category each expense falls into.
                YNAB uses the zero-balance budget method, which asks you to spend or save every dollar of income.
                It also comes with a bunch of pretty graphs, if that sort of thing excites you.
                College students can get a one-year “free” trial of YNAB.
                (“Free” in that you still need to give it billing information that will automatically kick in unless you jump through the hoops to delete your account.) The big claim to YNAB are the educational resources.
                It gives suggestions on how to allocate your money.
                (A fancier version of the 50-30-20 rule.)
            </p>

            <p>
                -PocketGuard.
                First, PocketGuard costs $75 per year.
                PocketGuard is a bit different.
                It is designed more around lowering expenses first and then budgeting afterward.
                It claims to help detect unnecessary subscriptions and will “negotiate” with certain companies for better rates.
                (E.g., a better monthly rate for Internet.) It connects to most of your financial accounts including your bank, credit cards, loan providers, etc.
                The budgeting aspect is fairly basic.
                After your automatic monthly expenses are deducted, you build your budget manually around it.
                It can auto-categorize expenses from your bank or credit card statements.
                <alert>I do NOT recommend “trying” PocketGuard to see if it lowers your bills.
                You will be charged $75 and locked into a subscription whether or not it actually does what it claims.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, <alert>please be careful with these apps</alert>.
                Whether it be becoming locked into a paid subscription or giving access to your financial information, these apps exist for the companies’ benefit.
                Your benefit is secondary to them.
                Do research and make informed decisions.

            <title>Cooking vs. Eating Out</title>r
            <sidebyside widths="50% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    Here’s an interesting question.
                    Which is cheaper: eating out of cooking yourself? The answer actually depends.
                    Let’s suppose you would like one hamburger and french fries.
                    Suppose the burger will be 1/3 lb with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.
                    At a restaurant in the Westfield area, a burger and fries will cost about $12 - $17 plus tax and tip.
                    So, about $15-$22.
                    If you go to fast food (e.g.
                    Five Guys or Burger King), you’re looking at a similar price minus tip.
                    So, about $13-$16.
                    If you want to make it yourself, you need ingredients.
                    This is where things get really variable.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <caption>Source: https://brokeassstuart.com/ 2022/02/16/why-are-restaurants-so-expensive-now/</caption>

                </figure>
            </sidebyside>
           
            <p>
                Suppose you have no ingredients needed.
                Ground beef is about $6/lb, sold in quantities of about 1.25 lbs.
                So, $7.50.
                A head of iceberg lettuce is about $2.50.
                One tomato will be about $1.
                A bottle of mayonnaise is about $4.
                A package of hamburger buns is about $4.
                A bag of french fries is about $4.
                Canisters of salt and pepper to season the burger will be about $5.
                So, everything together will be about $28 to cook yourself a hamburger and fries.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, let’s suppose you have a group of four people who will each get a hamburger and fries.
                Eating a restaurant will yield a bill of about $60-$80.
                Fast food will be $52-$64.
                However, the grocery price won’t change.
                It’s $28 because you’ll have enough with the ingredients to make four services.
                So, it works out to be $7 per person.
            </p>

            <p>
                In general, it is cheaper to cook at home when there are multiple people eating.
                However, cooking for just yourself can be a bit precarious, price-wise.
                That $28 for a burger and fries looks pretty daunting.
                The thing is, that $28 was based on the assumption that you had no ingredients.
                Suppose instead that you previous bought beef and french fries and froze what you didn’t use and already had items that can be stored like mayonnaise, salt, and pepper.
                Then you just need buns, lettuce, and tomato, which would run you about $7.50, which is a good deal cheaper than eating out.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, a general rule is that, over all, <alert>it is cheaper to cook yourself if you are prudent with saving ingredients.</alert>

                For this activity, list the two biggest or most frequent reasons that you go somewhere to eat.

            <p>
                Here is a general rule of grocery shopping.

            <p>
                Here is a quick example with chicken breasts.
                These photos were taken at the same store on the same day.
                Notice that for a package of two chicken breasts, the price is $3.49 per pound.
                If you buy a package of four chicken breasts, the price is $2.79 per pound.
                Suppose one chicken breast is around 0.7lbs.
                If you need four breasts, buying two packages of two breasts would be <m>4\times 0.7 \times 3.49 = \$9.77</m>, and buying the package of four breasts would be <m>4\times 0.7 \times 2.79 = \$7.81.</m>
            </p>

            <p>
                Why is this quantity phenomenon the case? There are actually a variety of reasons at play.
                One component is that buy selling you larger quantities at once, the store is selling more of its product and will likely need to discard as much expired food.
                So, they pass some of that savings to you.
                Another component is the hope that you will waste excess food.
                For example, if you only need three chicken breasts but buy a package of four, they are hoping you will discard that fourth breast rather than freeze and save it for later.
                There are also a plethora of reasons regarding supply chains and deliver costs.
                No matter the reasons, also remember the general rule of savings when buying in larger quantities.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is one issue with buying in bulk.
                Storage.
                If you thought to yourself in the chicken example, “but I only need one chicken breast for me,” you are thinking about the chicken you don’t have a plan for.
                That is a very common thought.
                To buy in bulk, you need a place to store excess food safely.
                For shelf-stable products like bottles of ketchup, which can last a long time in a refrigerator, it is easy to store such items.
                However, for highly-perishable items like chicken, it is less obvious.
            </p>

            <p>
                The answer is a <alert>freezer.</alert> A freezer is key to saving money at the grocery store.
                In fact, I may even recommend looking into a second chest freeze in addition to the freezer in your refrigerator.
                If you freeze perishable items, such as meats, you can spend much less on groceries over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, if you had a feeling of disgust at eating chicken that had been put into your freezer, then I am sorry to have to break it to you that the chicken at your supermarket was probably previously frozen already.
                Unless a product is labeled as “fresh” or “never-frozen,” it was probably frozen.
                Generally, never-frozen items cost more than the ones that have been frozen.
                The point is, it is highly recommended to get over the negative reactions to products that have been frozen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, some things can’t really be frozen, such as lettuce (which is why you’ll never see bags of 10lbs of lettuce at the store).
                Such items can’t really be bought in bulk.

            <title>Comparing Prices</title>

                <p>
                    Similar to buying in bulk is the concept of comparing prices.
                    Suppose you want to buy Pepsi.
                    A 2-liter bottle is $2.50, but 20oz bottles are on sale for $1.00 each.
                    Which is the better buy? If your math-phobia is starting to kick in, the good news is that most stores will tell you.
                    Kind of.
                </p>

                <figure>

            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                Most price tags at a large supermarket will have multiple numbers on it.
                Of course, there is the “retail price” - the price you will actually pay.
                However, there is often a second figure - the “unit price.” The unit price gives you how much you are spending on the product <em>per unit,</em> such as per pound, per ounce, per liter, etc.
                In fact, in Massachusetts, large retailers are required by law to tell you the per-unit price to help consumers make better decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the Pepsi example, the answer depends on what the per-unit prices are.
                If the unit is in fluid ounces, then the 2-liter bottle is about $0.04 per ounce.
                The 20oz bottles are $0.05 per ounce.
                So, the 2-liter bottle is consider the better buy.

                You should immediately get into the habit of looking at per-unit prices alongside the retail prices.
                It can help you make clear the price difference among different brands or different quantities.
                If you are looking to save money, go with the items with lower unit prices.
                Of course, if you cannot safely store larger quantities, it may not be best to buy in large quantities, even if the per-unit price is better.
                You never want to waste food, if you can avoid it.

                The number one reason why people go out to eat is to break up the stress and monotony that comes with work and maintaining a family and home day to day.
                One method for helping with this stress while also saving a great deal of money is to cook for more than one meal at a time.
                That is, prepare more servings of a meal and save them for later.
                Learning to use and appreciate leftovers is an excellent money-saving strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if you cook for a family of four, perhaps you could prepare a dinner to feed eight.
                Use four servings one night and save the other four servings for a night when you are really attempted to take everyone out to a restaurant.
                If you cook for yourself, you could perhaps prepare a dish meant to serve four and use the extra three servings as lunches to take to work or for dinners later in the week.

                Many people are averse to microwaved food.
                The solution there is to reheat objects in an oven.
                Yes, it takes longer, but ovens can help maintain the original water distribution in reheated food.

                    How does the thought of paying $30-$60 per year in order spend only 50%-90%of what you would at a grocery store sound?

                
                    Until the COVID lockdown, most consumers focused on the first question.
                    In resent years, many people’s minds have maneuvered to the second question.
                    Being a member of a wholesale club can potentially be a way to save a lot of money.

            <p>
                Firstly, “wholesale” refers to the concept of buying a product as it comes from its manufacturer.
                When you’re in line in a grocery store, do you notice that the candy bars they sell are in a box.
                The grocery store buys that box “wholesale” from the candy distributer.
                A <em>wholesale club</em> is a company that purchases whole items and will then sell those items wholesale to consumers for prices at or near what the club pays.
                So, think of it as being able to buy that box of candy for near the same price the grocery store pays.
                In essence, a wholesale club is where you can engage in expert mode of buying in bulk.
            </p>

            <p>
                A wholesale club gets much of its profits through membership fees.
                Those fees are used to pay employee salaries, invest for company growth, etc.
                When done right, it’s a surprisingly-stable business model.
                In our area, the biggest options are B.J.’s, Costco, and Sam’s Club.
                Although the most expensive, I recommend Costco for a variety of reasons.
                (How they treat employees, supply-chain robustness, ways to get your membership paid for, etc.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Just before writing this chapter, I did some reconnaissance.
                I looked at some unit prices of some common items at the West Springfield Costco and the Stop and Shop next door.
                The Stop and Shop prices are for the cheapest per-unit price I could find.

                These products are not unique.

                Sometimes a little cheaper, sometimes a lot.

                There are some downsides to wholesale clubs.
                First and foremost is the quantity of items.
                Some items are require a great deal of storage, such as an 18-pack of large paper towel rolls.
                Shopping at wholesale clubs requires room in your fridge/freezer, pantry, and closets.
                There is also the membership fee.
                Many people cannot part with the $30-$60 upfront.
                They are investments.
                There is also product rotation.
                Wholesale clubs make certain arrangements with suppliers.
                Many products have temporary availability.
                The last is crowds.
                People have come to appreciate the prices and supply chains wholesale clubs have.
                Many locations serve more customers per day than many prefer; they’re not the best places if you’re afraid of crowds.

                Some stores sell food products from brands that are not sold in major supermarkets.
                The thing about Americans is that brand recognition is one of the cornerstones of our economy.
                Do you even know what I’m talking about when I name products like adhesive strips, salicylates, hoop-and-loop fasteners, or personal water crafts? (Band-Aid’s, Aspirin, Velcro, and Jet-Ski.
                All of them just brands.) We tend not to trust brands we’ve never heard of.
                (Affinity bias!) It goes a step further.
                Take produce, which usually isn’t branded.
                We’re less likely to shop for produce at a place that doesn’t carry the brands on <em>other</em> products that we recognize.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you can get past your affinity bias, these stores can save you a lot of money.
                The chain in our region is Aldi’s.
                There are also independent markets all over the greater Springfield area.
                Some people might put Trader Joe’s in this category.
                If you’re having trouble getting over that bias, remember that most of the food that is sold in a place like Aldi’s come from the exact same factories and supplies as those sold in Big Y or Stop and Shop.
                It really is all down to brand recognition.

            <p>
                There is one major point of common misunderstanding about anchoring bias.
                Because of <em>how</em> sales are advertised, they can trigger our anchoring bias.
                However, the simple acting of buying an item that is on sale may not necessarily be anchoring bias.
                If you seeing something marked down causes you to be interested in a product you weren’t interested in before, that is anchoring bias.
                If there is an item that you buy all the time that goes on sale and you take advantage of the lower price, that isn’t really anchoring bias.
                It’s a good way to save money.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you do more and more of your own shopping, you’ll come to know what products you buy regularly.
                When one of those products goes on sale, it can be a good strategy to “stock up” on that item.
                For example, I use <em>a lot</em> of chocolate in my baking.
                I know I’ll use a hefty amount each week.
                When my usual chocolate bars go on sale, I buy a few week’s worth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many people call this strategy “couponing.” It is a good way to save money, but it can be dangerous.
                Shopping sales can trigger anchoring bias and influence you to buy something you weren’t planning on purchasing.
                In fact, our local Stop and Shops have tags that look like sales tags that say, “Great value! Stock up now.” Nothing is on sale.
                They’re trying to trigger your anchoring bias without actually offering any discount.

            <p>
                It’s that simple.

            <p>
                If you are turning your nose up at the idea, it may be because your expectations for standards of living for recent high school or college graduates really is.
                I know with three of my four kids, they whole-heartedly believed that they would be able to afford the same kind of home that they were leaving after high school.
                The truth is that your first independent housing that you have in your 20’s will likely be much different than the housing your parents or guardians have in their 40’s or 50’s.
                Needing to share a place with a roommate for your first few years on your own is extremely common, if not the path for most people.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of simple cost, would you rather pay $1,500 yourself for a one-bedroom apartment or split $1,800 with another person for a two-bedroom apartment? Splitting $1,800 would save you $600 per month, which is nothing to laugh at.
                $600 per month can be saved into a sizeable down payment on a housing in just a few years.

                There are a few techniques I’ll share than can help with utility costs.

                    First, utilities can either be supplied by a company or a town.
                    Almost always, utilities managed by a town are far cheaper than utilities supplied by a company.
                    The reason is simple; companies supply utilities for a profit, town’s are non-profit entities.
                    As an example, I lived in Palmer, MA previously.
                    In my last year, it cost about $300/mo to run air conditioners in the summer.
                    In my current place in Holyoke, MA, it costs about $100, if that.
                    Towns in our region that have utilities supplied by the town itself include Holyoke, Westfield, and Chicopee.

                Massachusetts has a fairly robust <alert>fuel-assistance</alert> program.
                These kinds of programs essentially help you pay for utilities.
                These are especially useful in your first few years in a career where you will not be making as much as your more experienced seniors.
                These programs are available to lower-income households, meaning that you cannot make more than a certain amount, which depends on a number of factors.
                I highly recommend applying to see if you’re eligible.

                My father has a habit that I thought was the strangest thing growing up.
                He turns off the water in the shower mid-cleaning.
                It’s to save money on both water and heating.
                Now that I pay my own bills, I see the wisdom in that level of frugality.
                In general, learning to having utilities on only when you are using them can really help save you money.
                Turn lights off when not in the room.
                Turn the heat or A/C down when you leave the house.
                Fill a sink with water for dishes rather than have a faucet run the whole time.
                Unplug non-essential things from wall sockets when not in use.
                You’d be surprised how much excess energy/water we can use over time.

                    A huge sector of our economy runs off people forgetting about subscriptions.
                    In fact, some companies will even offer introductory prices way below profitability to get you to sign up and hopefully forget them (or just now use them).
                    Gyms, ancestory sites, and fan subscriptions are some of the biggest culprits today.
                    Here is a general rule, if you haven’t used a service that you’ve been paying for in three months, why are you paying for it? Ditch it.
                    You can always restart it if you feel the need.

            <title>Pay Yourself First</title>

            <p>
                This technique was mentioned in the budgeting chapter, but it really is a great way to get yourself to reduce spending.
                When you “pay yourself first,” you put your planned amount into savings before you use any money on wants.
                For example, if your goal is to save 20%of your take-home pay, when you get your paychecks, you put 20%in savings right away.
                I highly recommend setting up an automatic system where some amount of money is automatically put into savings accounts.
                This can be done at the paycheck stage in which you can set some percentage of your paychecks to go to a savings account.
                It can also be after a paycheck is deposited into your main account in which a set amount is automatically transferred to a different savings account.
                When you have money automatically pulled into an account that is harder to withdraw money from, you essentially force yourself to do more with less money, saving you from overspending on wants.

            <title>Pay Off High-interest Debt</title>

            <p>
                If you find yourself with a decent amount of high-interest debt, such as credit cards or some student loans, you may want to focus some of your spending on paying off that debt, even if it means cutting way back on wants for a while.
                Many people pay hundreds or even thousands per month on just the interest on debt.
                If you can make the sacrifices needed to get out from under that debt, you’ll have a much more fulfilling life later on.

                            For this exercise, you will make your own monthly budget.
                            First, <alert>list out all our expenses and savings and classify them as needs, wants, and savings</alert>.
                            If there are any items you want to keep personal and don’t want me to see, just list it as “personal expense,” but still give the actual monthly amount that personal item costs.
                            Second, <alert>create your budget using whatever budget plan and technique you’d like, except for an app.</alert> (You may still use an app to budget, but in terms of submitting your budget for this assignment, an app would be a bit tedious.)

                            You have two options.
                            If you have a job, either full-time or part-time, and have some of your own expenses that you pay for, you can use your actual paychecks and expenses to create your budget.
                            If you do not currently work, you may create a hypothetical budget using income and expenses you might expect shortly after graduation.
                            (If you do this hypothetical budget, research how much the starting pay is for a job you could see yourself doing just after graduation.
                            Don’t use “average pay.” Also research realistic expenses in terms of housing, food, etc.
                            For your pay, take how much is reported for a starting pay and multiply by 0.7.
                            This will give you an approximate after-tax amount.)
