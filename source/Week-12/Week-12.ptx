            <alert>Taxes</alert> funds collected (levied) by governments from its citizens and other entities. 
            Funds collected from taxation fund many aspects of our daily lives. Taxes pay for work of some employees like teachers and police officer. 
            Taxes pay for the construction and maintenance of roads. Taxes pay for parks, schools, and other public grounds. 
            Taxes pay for some social services like Social Security or disability. Taxes pay for research and education, making your study at Westfield possible. 
            Taxes pay for goods and services that you interact with everyday, whether or not you currently pay any taxes.

            <title>Kinds of Taxes</title>
            <p>
                There are <alert>a lot</alert> of different kinds of taxes in the United States.
                We’ll go over some of the most common.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Payroll Taxes</em> - These taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. These taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. Your employer and you split these taxes. If you work for yourself, you will need to pay these when you file your taxes. These programs provide retirement and health benefits (old-age insurance is more accurate) to the elderly and some health benefits to certain people. These taxes are levied by the Federal government.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Income Taxes</em> - Income taxes are taxes you pay on many of your earnings over a year. Your paychecks, investment returns, small-business earnings, and other sources of income are taxed. These taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. If work for yourself, you pay these taxes when you file your taxes. The Federal government levies income taxes. Some stats also levy income taxes (like Massachusetts).
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Property Taxes</alert> - If you own property, you will pay taxes on it. The amount you pay is based on the value of the property and the tax rate set by the local government. These taxes fund local goods and services like building schools, many aspects of public safety, construction of parks, etc. Local governments, like cities or counties levy property taxes.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Excise Taxes</alert> - These are taxes on particular goods. Some products, like alcohol, cigarettes, gas, etc. have excise taxes on them. These taxes sometimes have special purposes. (For example, gas excise taxes often fund road construction/repair.) These taxes are levied by the Federal, state, and local governments.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Sales Taxes</alert> - Many products you buy are subject to these taxes. Sales tax is a fixed proportion of the sale price of a purchased good or service that is paid to a state and/or government. Not all states have sales taxes. Many products are exempt from sales tax in some states. (For example, clothing and food from grocers are exempt from sales tax in Massachusetts.) Formally, the seller of an good or service pays the sales tax, but that cost is put on the buyer and charged to them at the time of the sale.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>  

            <p>
                There are many other kinds of taxes in the US.
                There are inheritance taxes (taxes on inherited wealth beyond $1M, paid to state and Federal governments); occupancy taxes (takes paid on short-term lodging, paid to local governments); corporate taxes (taxes paid by corporations on profits they earn, paid to Federal and state governments); and tariffs (taxes paid on goods being imported or exported, paid to the Federal government); among others.

                It is important for you to understand what your tax dollars do and don’t do.
                As you grow older and become more concerned with how your local, state, and Federal governments operate, you need to have a working knowledge of what your money actually does.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is a brief list of what kinds of governments do with your taxes.

                            Federal Government - Funds Social Security, Medicare, national defense, national parks, scientific research, Federal social programs, Federal government employees, environmental protection, grants to state governments.
                        </p>

                            State Government - Education oversight (especially higher education), transportation, state social programs, state parks, public safety oversight.
                        </p>
                    </li>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-Much-Pay-Taxes">
            <title>How Much Do I Have to Pay in Taxes?</title>
            <p>
                If you’re really rich, nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
                But for most of us, the answer isn’t very simple.
                The answer depends on how much money you make, how you make your money, and what you spend your money on.
                There are even ways to reduce how much you pay in taxes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many taxes can be broken into one of three categories.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <alert>proportional</alert> or <alert>flat</alert> tax is one that is based on a set percentage of some value.
                Most textbooks refer to sales tax as a proportional tax because a percentage is set in each state/locality.
                If something costs $100 and the sales tax rate is 6%, then everyone who buys the item pays $6 in sales tax without exception.
                In a similar vein, property taxes are also considered a proportional tax.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <alert>progressive</alert> tax is one in which the tax rate changes based on income or value so that a larger tax rate is applied to those with more income or things with more value.
                Income taxes at the Federal level are progressive.
                Those who make very little money have a low tax rate.
                Those who make a whole lot have a higher tax rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                There can be <alert>regressive</alert> taxes.
                These would be the opposite of progressive taxes in that those with less income or things with lower value have a higher tax rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many taxes are hard to classify in this regressive, proportional, progressive classification.
                Take payroll taxes, for example (Social Security and Medicare).
                It is proportional, kind of.
                For people who make less than $176,000, 6.2%of their income is taxed via payroll taxes.
                However, if you make more than $176,000, the remaining income isn’t taxed.
                Take someone who made $50,000 last year.
                6.2%of their paycheck is taxed as payroll tax.
                Take someone who made $500,000 last year.
                Because only the first $176,000 is taxable via these payroll taxes, they pay only $10,912 in payroll taxes (or about 2.2%).
                So, are payroll taxes proportional or regressive?
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Do-Proportional-Taxes-Exist">
            <title>Do Proportional Taxes Exist?</title>
            <p>
                Some people claim that most taxes in the US are regressive.
                Take sales tax, for example.
                Suppose two people buy a television for $1,000.
                Suppose the first has a salary of $100,000 and the other has a salary of $200,000.
                Suppose the sales tax rate is 6%.
                The first would pay $60, or 0.06%of their salary on sales tax for that TV.
                The second would also pay $60, or 0.03%of their salary on sales tax for that TV.
                So, some people conclude that sales tax is actually regressive.
            </p>

        <title>Income Tax Filing</title>
        <p>
            If you earn income in a year, you’ll likely need to pay taxes on your income.
            When working for an employer, you’ll have taxes taken out of your paychecks.
            However, the amount taken out is an estimate of your actual tax <alert>burden</alert>.
            The exact amount you owe may not be clear until the end of the year.
            Very rarely do you pay the exact amount you need through your paycheck deductions.
            Most people overpay or underpay a bit.
            Through <alert>filing</alert>, you determine how much you should pay (or should have paid) in taxes.
            If you underpaid, you will owe the government more.
            If you overpaid, you are due a refund on the amount overpaid.

            <title>Terminology</title>
            <p>
                There is a great deal of terminology you should know when talking about taxes.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Gross Income</em> - Your gross income is the total amount of money you’ve made from all sources. Wages, tips, gifts, money you found on the street, interest, capital gains. Everything.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Adjusted Gross Income</em> - In terms of taxes, your adjusted gross income, or AGI, is more important. From the government’s point of view, some of the money you earned isn’t really your income. Some expenses have certain tax privileges that reduce your income in the eyes of the IRS, which is a good thing. Your AGI is calculated as your gross income minus these special expenses. Some of these expenses are listed below:

                        <p>
                            <em>Taxable Income</em> - Beyond your adjusted gross income, you can reduce your tax burden even more through exemptions and deductions. Your taxable income is the amount of your income that is actually taxed. It is calculated as your AGI minus the allowed amounts from exemptions and deductions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Tax Bracket</em> - Income tax is a progressive tax, meaning the more money you make, the higher your tax rate. The rate is not linear. There are a number of different ranges of income, and each has a corresponding tax rate. The income range your taxable income fall into is your tax bracket.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Exemptions</em> - Formally, we no longer use the term “exemptions’’ in Federal income taxation; the terms were eliminated in 2018. However, the idea remains. When the term was used, an exemption was an acknowledgement that it costs more to support a family of five than it is to support a family of two. Having to provide for children or other people reduces your tax burden by lowering your taxable income. Today, you provide the same information, such as whether you are married, how many kids you support, etc., which still affects your tax burden. However, the “exemption’’ term is no longer used.

                        <p>
                            <em>Deduction</em> - A deduction is an expense that lowers your taxable income. Some expenses that are difficult for the IRS to predict have been deemed to be worthy of some tax benefits. There are a great number of things that qualify as deductions. Things like some medical expenses, charitable donations, interest paid on your mortgage, amounts paid in state or local taxes, traditional 401(k)/403(b) contributions, gambling losses, and many more. The list also includes those that determine your AGI.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Standard Deduction</em> - The IRS can’t really track all legitimate deductible expenses for every citizen. So, there is the “standard deduction.’’ The standard deduction is an option for tax payers in which they can claim that they have spent an “average’’ amount of money on deductible expenses. For 2024, the standard deduction was $14,600 for a single person (or married and filing separately) and $29,200 for a married couple. Claiming the standard deduction reduces your taxable income from your AGI by that amount. It is simple and easy. It works well for people who do not want to track their deductible expenses or for families who don’t actually have that much in deductible expenses. If you take the standard deduction, you cannot claim any other deductions. So, for people who have a lot of deductible expenses, they should not take the standard deductible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Itemized Deduction</em> - For people who do not take the standard deduction, they will need to list out all of their deductible expenses. When they do this, these are called “itemized deductions.’’ While a bit of a pain, this process is well worth it for people with large incomes or a large amount of deductible expenses.

                            <em>Tax Credit</em> - A tax credit works similar to a deduction. However, a credit reduces how much you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar. The difference may sound subtle, but it is hugely important. Suppose you have a gross income of $100,000 and that your tax rate on the amount was 25%flat. Suppose you had a $20,000, making your taxable income $80,000. Then you’d pay 25%of that in taxes, or $20,000. Now suppose instead you had a tax credit of the same amount of the deduction: $20,000. You would be taxed on the full $100,000 and would owe $25,000 in taxes. However, your tax credit of $20,000 would go against that tax owed. So, you’d only have to pay $5,000 in taxes. Tax credits are pretty awesome. There are a number of things that earn you tax credits. Some higher-education expenses, having children of certain ages, adopting a child, having lower incomes, self-employment tax write-offs, energy-efficiency credits, and many more are available.

                            <em>Dependent</em> - A dependent is someone you support financially. The most common example is children or stepchildren (up through age 19 or 24 for full-time students). However, there can be other dependents in the form of elderly parents, siblings, disabled family members, etc. The number of dependents you have affects your tax burden.

                            <em>Refund</em> - If you overpay in taxes over the year, the IRS owes you the amount you overpaid. A tax refund is this amount you overpaid and are owed by the IRS. If you owe on taxes from a previous year, any refund will automatically be used to pay those backtaxes.

            <title>Tax Brackets and Rates</title>
            <p>
                The function of tax brackets is a little weird, but it is designed to be more fair.
                When I said that those who make more pay a higher tax rate, I was partially lying.
                Let’s take the two lowest tax brackets as examples.
                For 2024, the lowest tax bracket applies to those with taxable incomes between $0 and $11,600, which has a tax rate of 10%.
                The second lowest applies to those with taxable incomes between $11,601 and $47,150, which has a tax rate of 12%.
                Let’s take two people, one with taxable income of $10,000 and one with taxable income of $20,000.
                The idea is that it would be unfair for the one who has higher taxable income to pay a higher rate on the same amount than the one with the lower taxable income.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the compromise.
                The first person pays the 10%on their taxable income, which would work out to be $1,000.
                The second person also pays only 10%on their taxable income for the <alert>first</alert> $11,600.
                The remaining $8,400 of their $20,000 taxable income would be taxed at the higher 12%rate.
                So, they’d owe <m>11,600 \times 0.1 + 8,400 \times 0.12 = \$2,168.</m>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            $74,500
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                            $205,111
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            $240,017

                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                1 - $48,000 lies in the third bracket.
                So, they would pay 10%on the first $11,600.
                They would pay $12 on the amounts from $11,601 to $47,150.
                They would pay 22%on the remaining $850.
                (850 was calculated from <m>48,000 - 47,150</m>.) The key here is that you apply the tax rate to the amount within each tax bracket.
                The first bracket has a span of <m>11,600 - 0 = 11,600</m>.
                The second bracket has a span of <m>47,150 - 11,600 = 35,550.</m> So, the total amount of tax owed is <m>(11,600 \times 0.1) + (35,550 \times 0.12) + (850 \times 0.22) = \$5,613</m>.

        <title>Tax Forms</title>
        <p>
            There are some tax forms that many of you have already seen, and most of you will see.  We’ll cover some of the most common.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-W4">
            <title>W4</title>
            <p>
                The W4 form is a form you fill out for your employer when you are hired.
                This form helps them and the IRS estimate how much you’ll owe in taxes for the year and how much to take from your paychecks.
                In such a scenario, you don’t actually make payments to the government.
                Instead, your employer pays the government and reduces the amount in your paycheck.
            </p>

            <p>
                The W4 will take your personal information.
                It will also ask for information that used to fall under “exemptions.” So, you will indicate whether you are married, how many dependents you have, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is one important box for married people or people with multiple jobs.
                There will be a line asking if you would like to have additional money taken out of your check for taxes.
                You may have the gut reaction of “hell no!” But hear me out.
                Suppose you and your spouse each made $35,000.
                When you fill out your W4, all they have to go on is your $35,000 salary.
                So, they will tax you based on that amount (tax bracket).
                However, with your spouse’s and our incomes combined, you bring in $70,000 together, which puts you into the next tax bracket.
                However, if both of you paid taxes individually under the assumption that you would be taxed at the lower bracket rate, you would be in for a huge rude awakening when you went to file your taxes at the end of the year.
                You would almost certainly owe a lot more than you were expecting.
                A similar thing can happen if you work multiple jobs.
                If you are married or have multiple jobs, it may be best for you to request extra money be taken out with each check.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-I9">
            <title>I9</title>
            <p>
                An I9 is simply a form your employer uses to verify that you’re able to work legally in the US.
                You’ll need to provide proof of citizenship, legal residency, and/or work eligibility to your employer when they fill it out.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-W2">
            <title>W2</title>
            <p>
                If you work for an employer, you will get a W2.
                They are generally sent out each January.
                Your W2 is your summary sheet that you will use to file your taxes.
                It contains how much you earned in gross pay, how much you paid in taxes, how much you contributed to retirement accounts, 
                how much you paid in health insurance premiums through your work, and a few other items. 
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-W9">
            <title>W9</title>
            <p>
                Subcontracting is becoming more and more common.
                You are a subcontractor if you perform work for someone, but you are not their employee.
                (Think of Uber drivers in most states.) Since they are not your employer, you do not fill out a W4 when you’re hired.
                However, they still must report how much they paid you (and thus your income) to the government.
                So, you fill out a W9, which gives them your personal identifying information for taxation purposes.
            </p>
        </subsection>
        
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-1099">
            <title>1099</title>
            <p>
                If you get income from anywhere else, you can report it via a 1099 form.
                If you have interest income, money you made from selling homemade soap, or $100 you found in the gutter, you can report it on a 1099.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are asking yourself why you would self-report income that no one seems to know about that will only be taxed, keep in mind that it isn’t really that hard for the IRS to sniff out discrepancies.
                The last thing you want is to be audited.
                You’ll have to pay fines and late fees.
                If you purposely avoid disclosing a larger amount of income, you could go to jail for tax evasion.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-1098">
            <title>1098</title>
            <p>
                A 1098 form can help reduce the amount of taxes you owe.
                If you pay interest on student loans or a mortgage, you can reduce your taxable income via this form.

    <section xml:id="sec-Filing-Taxes-and-the-1040-Form">
        <title>Filing Taxes and the 1040 Form</title>
        <p>
            We left out what might be the most important tax form - the 1040 form.
        </p>    

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-1040-Form">
            <title>The 1040 Form</title>
            <p>
                By April 15th of every year, you must submit your 1040 form and any owed taxes to the IRS.
                Your 1040 form is essentially a worksheet that you use to determine how much you owe in taxes for the year and how much more you still need to pay (or how much you are owed).
                If you are wondering why the IRS doesn’t do it for you, the reason is that there is no way for the IRS to know what deductible expenses you had over the year.
                For example, they’ll have no way of knowing if you had $1,000 in gambling losses.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the surface, filling out a 1040 is not particularly difficult.
                You enter the information from your W2, perform the required addition/subtraction, and compare what you paid in taxes over the year to what you actually need to pay.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue is that taxes can get really complicated for some.
                If you qualify for a credit, you’ll need to fill out the corresponding form.
                If you want to itemize deductions rather than take the standard deduction, you’ll need to fill out a form in which you do so.
                If you own a small business in which your personal and business taxes are intertwined, there is a lot that goes into figuring out your tax burden.
                There’s a reason tax accountants exist.
