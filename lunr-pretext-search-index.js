  "body": " Welcome to Money and You!  Welcome to Money and You! I am thrilled that you are part of my course. I hope that this course will end up being one of your most useful in your undergraduate curriculum. Understanding personal finance and how you think and act about money can benefit you in a number of ways.  Money and You is a twist on a traditional personal finance course. Over the semester, you will learn the fundamentals of managing your money, which you will be able to use for the rest of your life. You will learn techniques for setting a budget; why and how to build credit; the process, benefits, and drawbacks of buying a home; the world of insurance; taxes as they apply to you; loans and debt; car-buying; scams; saving for retirement; using modern finance tools; and setting financial goals.  The twist on this course is the opportunity to reflect on how you (individually) behave around and think about money. You will develop techniques to manage stress about money, explore how money can affect your relationships, reflect on why you want certain things, explore your feelings about risk and reward, and consider why long-term financial goals can be difficult without the proper mindset.   What this course is not   This course is not a how to get rich quickly lesson. It is more of a how to accumulate wealth slowl course. Let's just get this out of the way now. If there were a proven track to move into the upper class, it wouldn't be some secret that is easily divulged in a self-help book or class. The course is about setting and achieving realistic and manageable financial goals.   Source: https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/the-way-to-get-rich-quick-is-to-do-it-slowly-3d102cfbea9d     This course is not a course on investment techniques. We will cover how to save for retirement, which can involve investing, but we will not explore specific investment strategies like picking particular stocks or trying to predict the crypto market. We will explore what finance experts do with their own money and why. We will explore general strategies for saving. We will not make any speculations or bets on particular investment opportunities.  Cards on the table, I am a professor of mathematics. However, this course is not a mathematics course. Of course, there will be numbers since money is a quantitative object. You will not need to memorize complex formulas. You will need to be able to understand some arithmetic and how to apply arithmetic in the context of some applied problems, but you will have access to pretty much all computational tools you would like.   Source: https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/dogbert-s-get-rich-quick-scheme-is-scam-FzCOthK      Course Norms  Let's talk about the expectations and norms for this class.    Source: https:\/\/www.edutopia.org\/blog\/ establishing-classroom-norms-todd-finley    First and foremost, everyone should feel welcome and included in this class. Each of us comes into this class with different experiences, identities, ideas, and social positions. You can expect of me to foster an environment in which you can reach your academic goals. I will expect of you, in-turn, to participate in that learning environment and contribute positively to other's learning. Contributing positively to the learning environment means the following expectations (among others):      Everyone is allowed to exist as themselves. Harassing, dismissive, violent, disrespectful, or discriminatory rhetoric\/behavior is not allowed. You are allowed to be who you are. Give that same freedom to others. It is ok to disagree. It is not ok make someone else feel less valuable. I reserve the right to request students who engage in such behavior be removed from the course. If you feel that something I have said during class does not support your right to be yourself, please let me know.    I will often ask you to talk or work in small groups. You should contribute to your groups in meaningful ways. If you would prefer to work on a task individually, please feel comfortable to let me know.    During class, you may think and write in whichever language you choose. However, please be aware that there are very few languages that I can read fluently. So, please try to write submitted work in English (or something that I can read). Also note that talking in small groups will require you to communicate effectively with each other.    Class attendance and participation is important for this course. Please come to our classroom before the time begins and plan to stay until the end of the period. You are welcome to leave the class for short periods of time as necessary. However, arriving to class extremely late or disappearing for long periods of time will be considered as an absence.    Let's do it. Let's talk about AI. No college course is about you turning some pieces of paper that say the right thing for college credit. It is about learning what you need to succeed in your career, becoming an educated and compassionate citizen, and learning how to formulate your own ideas and communicate them effectively. I am not opposed to you using AI appropriately . Here is the general rule for this course: AI should not be used to generate ideas. Use it to correct your grammar. Use it to delve deeper into a topic you want to know more about. Do not ask AI to write out a solution or submission for any assignment. This includes just using it to check an answer. Your submitted assignments should be a representation of how you connect with the material. Using AI inappropriately will be considered a violation of the University's Academic Honesty Policy. If you have any questions about appropriate AI use, please let me know.      Source: https:\/\/www.kent.edu\/today\/news\/adding-ai-cheating-and-plagiarism-policy       I understand that life happens. Sometimes, unexpected things require us to focus on other things. I will keep this in mind regarding attendance and assignment submission. However, I will expect honest, timely, and open communication. If you need to miss a class to attend a major event, let me know ahead of time so we can work something out. Poor communication or ghosting the course are harder things to be flexible about.    Feel safe but avoid safetyism. Safetyism is an obsession with eliminating or avoiding threats (even imaginary ones) to such an extent that you are unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs or accommodations necessitated by practical or moral concerns. It is the belief that it is unhealthy to experience negative emotions. In order to learn, you need to struggle a bit. No one is a master of everything. It's ok to feel confused. It's ok to be disappointed. It's ok to think about things that are a bit uncomfortable. A big part of this course will be reflecting on how you relate to money. I'll tell you now, you're going to have a lot of negative emotions regarding finances over your life. This course will help you prepare for those emotions, but you need to be willing to really think and explore your own mind. Don't withdraw from challenge. Don't hide from life.      "

  "body": " Money and You   Activity: What do you want to learn?   Let's actually get started with personal finance. Here is the thing. Personal finance courses can be pretty ubiquitous. There are some things we'll definitely touch on, but you may have some particular questions about personal finance that you are hoping to explore in this course. I'd like to include some of your questions, if possible. So, your first activity for the course will be   Source: https:\/\/www.fragassoadvisors.com\/ financial-literacy-month\/     to come up with three questions regarding personal finance that you would like to see covered in this course. I'm not promising to answer everything. (I won't tell you what stocks to buy.) But please ask about things you are genuinely interested in.    Small-group conversation: Why do you want to learn financial literacy?  I'm assuming you chose to enroll in this course for a reason. Yes, you earn college credit and tick off one of the Wellness courses. But really, why are you here? Why did you choose this course and why are you interested in personal finance? If you do not want to learn personal finance and are simply stuck here, why do you not want to learn personal finance? Talk with a few people close to you.    Debrief  What I hope we can see is that why personal finance is needed or interesting differs from person to person. It depends on who we are. People who are very future oriented may want to know about how to best prepare for the future. People who are spenders may want to see some techniques for making a paycheck stretch further. People may have heard that certain concepts are important but don't know much about them. There are many more potential reasons to be interested in personal finance. They're all valid.  Notice that this means that there is no singular, concrete goal for this course. We all will appreciate different topics. What is important is that you understand why you are interested in personal finance, and your reason is a good one.    Activity: Money personality quiz   We all have different ways in which we relate to money. Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil. Some adore or worship money and wealth. Some are very indifferent to money.   Source: https:\/\/www.bankatfirst.com\/personal\/ discover\/flourish\/money-personalities.html     We all have different ways in which we relate to money. Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil. Some adore or worship money and wealth. Some are very indifferent to money. No relationship to money is the right one or the wrong one. However, how you think about money absolutely influences your life, both day-to-day and long term. Setting financial goals is important, but if you try to set goals while ignoring your connection to money, you are likely setting yourself up for failure.  You are going to take a short quiz. There are no right answers. There are points assigned to different options, but points are not necessarily a good thing or bad thing. For each question, do not answer as if anyone will look at these because no one will. Do not answer based on what you think is the most socially acceptable. Really think about each question and be comfortable selecting the answer that best describes you. Please note that this is not an official test. It is just meant to get you to start thinking about your own connection to money.      I would be better off if I had more money.

Money Worshipper. A money worshipper often equates wealth with success or status. They tend not to be shy or anxious regarding finances. They believe that money is an important part of their connection to society. A money worshipper can be either a saver or a spender, but is usually a spender. Positive traits of a money worshipper is that they may have the motivation to work harder to accumulate wealth and may be more charitable. Possible pitfalls of a money worshipper include over-spending, amassing debt, having an unhealthy money fixation, and relationship stresses. Being too much of a money worshipper may mean a belief that accumulating wealth and status supersedes morality or ethics.   Money Avoider. A money avoider tries to avoid thinking or talking about financial issues. The topic of money can make them feel anxious. Sometimes, a money avoider equates wealth with lower morals. The potential benefits of being a money avoider can include making ethical decisions without the influence of money. Unfortunately, avoidance has many pitfalls including a reluctance to budget or plan financially. They may tend to over-rely on others for getting basic needs. A money avoider may also experience relationship stresses regarding finances.   Money Saver. A money saver is more future-oriented and prefers to accumulate money to prepare for the future. The benefits of being a saver include understanding the importance of being financially-prepared, a willingness to budget, and being prudent. The potential pitfalls of being a money saver include becoming a miser or overly-cynical of spending. They may over-stress on finances and refuse to engage in practical spending.   Money Spender. A money spender is more present-oriented and tends to use the money they have rather than save it for later. The benefits of being a spender include being willing to engage in more self-care and being more open to a variety of events or experiences that cost money. Pitfalls include over-spending, lacking discipline to adhere to a budget, and relationship stresses.   Money Indifferent. Someone who is money indifferent does not feel excited or anxious about money. People who are money indifferent generally are either wealthy enough to never have to worry about money, or they have adopted an out of sight - out of mind mentality. Not many people truly fit into this category. Most people get either anxious or excited about money, but they may test into this category if they do not answer truthfully about certain scenarios. Those truly indifferent to money may have an easier time navigating relationships as money is less important to them. However, they may also avoid necessary financial planning.   Source: https:\/\/blog.bankbazaar.com\/ what-type-of-money-personality-are-you\/     There are also some hybrid personalities.'   Money Status. A person who is both a money worshipper and money spender tend to focus on accumulating outward-facing symbols of wealth. They may prioritize buying an expensive car rather than investing their money. They may work very diligently to accumulate wealth. However, they may take on too much risk and may make dangerous social comparisons.   Money Vigilant. A person who is both a money avoider and money saver may be money vigilant. Someone who is money vigilant can be anxious or guarded around topics of personal finance. Benefits include a willingness to save and budget, not overspending on luxury items, and overall prudence. Pitfalls can be becoming a miser or over-stressing about finances.   Money Monk. A person who is both a money avoider and money spender may be a money monk. Someone who is a money monk can feel guilty when they have money. They do not like talking about money, but they are willing to work for it. They tend to spend much of their money on others. Benefits can include less stress in personal relationships and having a charitable spirit. Pitfalls include overspending and being unwilling to save for the future.   Money Hoarder. A person who is both a money worshipper and money saver may be a money hoarder. A money hoarder appreciates wealth and equates it to status. However, they do not outwardly display wealth to others. The benefits of being a money hoarder is a willingness to budget and save for the future. Pitfalls can include refusing to spend on things important for their health and having trouble navigating relationships.  As an example, here are my results: (1,F); (2,A); (3,B); (4,E); (5,E); (6,B); (7,B); (8,E); (9,E); (10,B); (11,B); (12,F); (13,F); (14,D); (15,A); (16,B); (17, B); (18, F); (19, E); (20,E).  So, my point allocation would be: Money Worshipper - 1 point. Money Avoider - 7 points. Money Saver - 7 Points. Money Spender - 5 Points. Money Indifferent - 2 Points.  My dominant personality types seem to be a Money Avoider and a Money Saver. I could then label myself as being money vigilant.     Debrief  What should you take away from this activity? As you explore personal finance and start planning for your present and future, you need to work with yourself. Working against yourself will make financial planning difficult and stressful. For example, if you are a money spender and do not accept that part of your personality, saving and budgeting will be much harder for you. You may find yourself asking, why can't I stop buying X? . If you can identify your relationship to money, it will help you assess what you already do well and what you need to work on.  You cannot change the entire world's connection to money. You cannot change someone else's relationship to money. You can only work on yourself. By understanding how you think about and use money, you can become more mindful of all the emotions that money can bring and be more prepared for them. You want to make sound, prudent decisions about money that will work toward your personal financial goals. You need to truly know yourself to make these decisions.   "

  "body": " Money Psychology  At the end of the day, financial well-being is large a product of the decisions we make with our money. Knowing all about the world of finance the consequences of decisions is not enough to maintain financial health. You must also know why you make the decisions you do. Having an understanding of yourself will help you keep on making sound financial decisions and avoid poor ones.   Money Personality  You have seen a glimpse of money personality and have thought about your own. Your money personality shapes your beliefs and values regarding your finances (and even the whole financial world). These beliefs and values directly affect how you think about money. For example, suppose you have $10,000 saved into an account. A person who is a saver will likely value security over spending and would be more inclined to continue saving or investing that money. A money worshipper may value financial status and be more inclined to spend the money on something like a down payment for a fancy car. A money spender may value exciting experiences and see that money as an international vacation.  The point is that it helps to know yourself around money. Suppose you have that $10,000 and \\textit{know} you shouldn't spend it, but you find yourself unable to stop thinking about all you could buy with it. Realizing that your money personality may drive you more toward spending can allow you to be more mindful of your feelings. Realize that your feelings are not wrong. Feel your feelings. But go with what you know is the best option for you. With practice, this becomes easier and easier.    Money Biases   Everyone is unique, right? Well, some aspects of money psychology are so common that there are names for them. In fact, many advertisements and salespeople utilize some of these aspects to manipulate you into spending your money. We'll discuss these tactics when we explore scams and manipulation.   Source: https:\/\/www.tataaia.com\/blogs\/life-insurance\/10-biases-investors-should-keep-in-mind-when-conducting-investments.html     Generally speaking, a bias is a thought, opinion, practice, etc. that is so imbedded in your brain that it affects your behavior without you realizing it. A bias is not as simple as I like X better than Y. They are subtle, but powerful. Most people are unaware of their biases until those biases are confronted. Even then, many people choose not to accept their own biases. We will go through some of the most common financial biases.   Society Bias. Have you ever thought about needing the latest model of a phone, even though yours still works fine? Is it the extra 26 minutes of battery life? Is it the extra 0.4MP resolution on the camera? No. It's about status. Cellular phones and smartphones have been symbols of status since their creation. (Seriously, look at who bought the first cellular phones.) Status symbols can drive many of us to make purchases that stretch our budgets. Many people buy the largest homes their budgets can possibly afford when a smaller one would be just as functional. Many people dine at expensive restaurants mostly for the opportunity to post a photo of their meal to social media. Similarly, some people buy the latest smartphones so that they can have the largest number available.    Endowment Effect. The endowment effect is less about buying and more about selling. Have you ever run a garage sale (or tag sale for you New Englanders) or tried to sell a car of phone? That feeling you get when you are offered a price less than what you feel is owed is the endowment affect. An interesting commonality in human psychology is that once we own an item we feel as though it is worth more.   Source: https:\/\/customercamp.co\/endowment-effect\/     Imagine this scenario. You buy a car that has a value of $25,000. However, the second you sign the paperwork and own the car, the car's value drops to $20,000 because the car now has a previous owner and has depreciated. How does that make you feel? Are you feeling, Oh, that totally makes sense that my car is worth less ? Or are you feeling, That's bull. If I haven't driven the car, it's still worth what I paid for it ? Probably the latter. The thing with the endowment effect is that it can cause people to hold onto items that they really want to sell. Rather than earning some cash on an item you want to sell, you get no money and need to keep owning your item.    Loss Aversion. One of the workers behind the endowment affect is loss aversion, but loss aversion is a mental bias all its own. In general, people prefer to avoid losing money rather than making gains. Don't believe me? Think about this scenario. You can play a game. You have a 75% chance of winning it. If you win, you double your life savings. If you lose, you lose all your life savings. Do you play the game?   Source: https:\/\/cognitivebias.io\/bias\/loss-aversion     From a mathematical standpoint, the answer is clearly yes! However, most people will not take that bet because of loss aversion. Loss aversion has the potential to make you miss out on financial opportunities and investment gains. Now, a 25% chance of losing your life savings is a bit extreme, but loss aversion can affect much smaller financial decisions. Here's a common example with stocks. When investors see a good gain in a day, they are happy but not shocked. However, when a loss of a similar magnitude happens, the feeling of that loss hits much harder. Many investors will then pull their money out of investments when they see a sudden loss. However, selling a stock when it hits a low is generally not a good idea. (On the other hand, some stocks will continue to decline, and investors may choose not to sell due to loss aversion.)    Anchoring Bias. Here is a huge one that is the foundation of a lot of advertising schemes. (We'll dig in more later as to how.) Anchoring bias is now closely tied to the idea of a sale or deal. Seeing a product being offered for a price less than it was originally can make us want to buy that product, regardless of whether it worth that much.   Source: https:\/\/thedecisionlab.com\/biases\/anchoring-bias     Do you notice that sale tags always tell you the price before the sale. It's to trigger your anchoring bias. There is a lot to discuss regarding manipulation and anchoring, but that will come in a later week. For now, be aware that this bias exists. When making decisions on what to buy, do not concentrate on what was. Concentrate on what is. It doesn't matter that the pack of Oreos is usually $4 and is $3 today. Were you going to buy Oreos anyway? Is $3 the price you're willing to pay?   Present Bias. It is usually easier to concentrate on what you're feeling now compared to what you may feel in the future. Present bias is the concept of living in the present. Living in the present is great for mindfulness, but it can be detrimental to making future plans. Living too much in the present can cause overspending on things you want now rather than saving for the future. Of course, it isn't good to live totally in the future and become a miser. Working with your present bias takes practice and hard work. Your brain is hard-wired to want what you want now. Delaying gratification for a much stronger sense of happiness takes conscious effort. Try to get into the habit of asking what you're giving up by spending money now. By buying the latest model phone now instead of skipping a generation, what financial goals or milestones are you delaying? By ordering that doughnut at Dunkin', what nutritional goals are you giving up? You do not need to sacrifice everything that makes you happy, but you need to have an eye toward the future. Your future self will thank you.   Confirmation Bias. Have you ever scoured the Internet looking for opinions to help you make an important decision? Often, people find a scenario in which most of the information tells them not to make a certain choice, but they only really accept the small bit of information that supports making that choice. This is confirmation bias at work.    Source: https:\/\/qualityedge.com\/articles\/ confirmation-bias\/    Here's an example (not really financial). I am currently debating whether to get surgery on my spine to help with neurological pain. I've been debating this surgery for three years. When I have particularly bad flare-ups, I look for people's opinions and experiences with the surgeries. I find myself much more likely to read stories of successes rather than warnings or bad experiences.   This is likely because that main pain has made me unconsciously decide to get the surgery, and I am looking for confirmation of that opinion. Confirmation bias pops up constantly when making financial decisions. If you find yourself looking at information and only clicking on certain articles, posts, or sites, there is likely confirmation bias at work. It is important to remain objective as you make important decisions and accept all credible information as credible.  Just as a point of reference. Confirmation bias exists everywhere. It is one of the cornerstones of racism, conspiracy theories, homophobia, tribalism, etc. It is a really, really strong bias that every person on this earth has. Being more aware of it can help you make decisions that are actually in your own interest rather than making poor decisions and mentally-manipulating what you see to confirm that poor decision.   Affinity Bias. Related to confirmation bias is affinity bias. Affinity bias can be thought of as brand loyalty that can cause some inefficient financial decisions. For example, many adults ignore cheaper store-brand items in grocery stores (or even refuse to try shopping at a place like Aldi's); they instead only purchase items from brands they recognize. Sometimes there may be sound reasons for this restriction, but often the differences are minimal. For example, many store brand items are actually manufactured in the same factory as name-brand ones. The only difference is packaging.  Affinity bias doesn't have to be objectively bad. Many people make conscious efforts to support or not support certain businesses or products. For example, many people refuse to shop at Walmart, despite it being cheaper, because they do not support the low wages paid to employees or the forced closures of small businesses. What is important is for you to be aware of affinity bias and make conscious choices that fit with your preferences and financial goals.    Herd Mentality. Very much related to social bias is herd mentality. You have likely heard of it before. It's the thing everyone says people different from them follow and is what hipsters claim to be immune to. We are all under the effect of herd mentality. It's easy to see when other people are following a herd, particularly when we don't like that particular herd. It is much harder seeing when you are following a herd.   Source: https:\/\/tecnosoluciones.com\/ marketing-by-influencers-what-is-it-and-how-to-handle-it-correctly\/?lang=en     The consequences of herd mentality in the financial world (and beyond) are many. Herd mentality can cause you to buy something you really don't need or even convince you that you do need an item. It can cause investors to buy stocks that have been on the rise right before a bubble burst. In the modern world, the two most prevalent sources of herd mentality are in rating systems and influencers. Did you most recipe ratings online are fake? Did you know most Amazon reviews on a product are not for the actual product you're interested in? Yet they're important factors in determining our behavior. Speaking as someone who grew up before social media, I cannot tell you how bonkers I find the idea of watching an influencer. Yet followers beget more followers, which is the very concept of herd mentality.    Activity: Think About Your Biases  Pick three of the biases above that you have experienced in some way. (If you think you haven't been influenced by these biases before, think harder.) For each bias, briefly describe a time when that bias affected your thinking or behavior. Briefly reflect on how being mindful of those biases could lead (or have led) to better decisions.    Debrief  One thing to notice is that thinking about weaknesses in the way we think is difficult. That's because of the biggest bias of all - self-bias. We trust our own thoughts more than ones that conflict with them. That's ok; it's part of being human. However, like it or not, biases affect your behavior. Some may be more prone to certain biases than others, but bias is part of the human condition. From a financial standpoint, learning to recognize your own biases can help you make more informed and beneficial decisions about your money.   "

  "body": " Setting Financial Goals   I'm willing to bet you have some financial goals already. Maybe you want to buy a house one day. Maybe you're already thinking about how to retire. Maybe you want to save up for the next Taylor Swift concert. If you have financial goals already, that's great. If not, that's okay too.   Source: https:\/\/www.signaturebankga.com\/ financial-goals-every-small-business-and-entrepreneur-should-have\/      Activity: Preliminary Financial Goals  Before we dive into setting good financial goals, I want you to physically write out at least two financial goals that you have. No restrictions.    STAR Financial Goals  Here is the thing about most financial goals. They usually fail. It's unfortunate, but true. The reason for failure usually isn't bad luck or an economic downturn. Most financial goals are doomed from the start. This is because most financial goals are vague and have no realistic plan behind them. Maybe a financial goal of yours is to be able to buy a house. It is a nice enough goal, but it is vague with no plan. When do you want to buy the house? How will you save up for it? Is your plan realistic?  A good financial goal need to have certain characteristics. We'll use saving for a home as an example.   Specific. A financial goal can't be vague. It needs to be specific. Suppose you would like to buy a house? Depending on the size, location, and type of house you may want, the finances involved will vary wildly. You'll need a down payment, which can be (maybe possibly) as low as 3.5%, but preferably 20%, of the house's value. Maybe the kind of home you're interested in will be worth about $300,000 by the time you buy it, and you want a 15% down payment. Then your more specific goal is, I want save $45,000 to buy a home. This goal is specific.   Timed. Your financial goal should have timing to it. In how long will you achieve your goal? How often will you perform a necessary action to work toward that goal? If your goal is to save $45,000 for a down payment, then ask when will I have that $45,000? and how often will I put money aside for it? For example, you could say, I want to save $45,000 to buy a home in ten years by saving $400 each month.    Achievable. Your financial goal should be achievable. That is, it should possible given your current financial situation. Your goal should not bank on the hope that you will land a seven-figure job. Setting a goal of owning a private island is likely not achievable for anyone in this class without some huge inflow of resources. (Did reading that sentence trigger any emotions in you? Make note, if so.) You cannot simply say, Well, I'll get a job that pays millions. You need to be honest about your limitations. The key question is, What can you manage right now ? Buying an island isn't very likely or reasonable. On the other hand, buying a home is achievable. About two-thirds of Americans live in a home owned by the occupants. (Note that this is not saying that two-thirds of people or families own their homes!)  Consider the goal of saving $400 each month for a house down payment. The question is whether this goal is achievable or not, given the person's current financial situation. If not, the goal may need to be altered, or you may need to change your current financial situation.   Realistic. Similar to being achievable, financial goals need to be realistic. Being realistic includes being abstractly achievable, but it also includes making the saving process more tangible. What I mean is that, for example, saving $400 each month may be well within the realm of being possible or achievable. However, realistically, how will you do it? Perhaps, your goal could be, I want to save $45,000 for a down payment on a home in ten years by saving $200 from each of my biweekly paychecks. Depending on your situation, this may or may not be realistic. If not, can you change some numbers to make it realistic? Maybe the goal could be, I want to save $50,000 for a down payment on a house in fifteen years by saving $135 from my biweekly paychecks.     Activity: Setting STAR Financial Goals  Now is your time to practice. Come up with two financial goals that are specific, timed, achievable, and realistic. They do not need to be lofty like buying a house, but they certainly can be.    Debrief  I want you to notice something about what you may be feeling after thinking about financial goals. If you started thinking about what you can realistically do to save money, you likely started feeling stressed. That is okay. In fact, setting financial goals is usually stressful. However, stress is not always bad. (Look up eustress. ) There are a couple reasons for this stress.   First, a financial goal means you can't have what you want now , and that's tough in today's modern society. Everything can be delivered to your door in 2 days. International trade allows for items to be manufactured at extremely low prices. Our society is built around getting what we want immediately.   Source: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/how-manage-financial-stress-anxiety-nonjabulo-sikhakhane     It's stressful to confront the very real fact that you can't always get what you want right away (or ever in some cases). (If you want some context for relatively-recent history of buying stuff, ask your parents or grandparents about ordering from the Sears catalog.) It is important that you learn to confront this stress. The more you practice accepting that some goals take time and effort to achieve, the better you will become at achieving them. It's not a simple thing to do, but it does get easier with practice.  Most financial goals require you to save. Honestly, saving money stinks. Saving money means you have less to spend, which means you need to make some sacrifices in regards to what you buy. For example, one long-term STAR goal I have is to save for my retirement by putting aside the maximum allowed contribution (currently $7,000 a year) into my IRA by depositing $270 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks. It's a good goal, but that goal means I have about $540 each month that I can't spend. Thinking about what I could do with an extra $7,000 each year is stressful. However, with the right mindset and some discipline, I accept that my financial goal takes priority over that extra spending money. Here is one tip. Do not think of saving as a sacrifice. If feasible, think of it as part of your regular budget - something that you need to do with each paycheck. Commit to it with a concrete plan and stick with it. It doesn't take long until saving is a habit.  Perhaps some of you began to actually worry about practically working toward your goals. This may be a sign that your goal isn't achievable or realistic. When a goal requires you to save, the goal should be one that is within your power to work toward. If your goal is too lofty or requires too much financial compromising, you won't be able to stick to it. Remember that it is always better to make slower, healthy progress than fast, unsustainable progress. Burnout is very real.  This debrief is not meant to make you feel stress. It is to help you be mindful of any stress you may feel. Stressing over finances doesn't mean you're goals are bad, and it is okay to feel some stress over them. Work with that stress to formulate and follow STAR goals.    Example of a Goal Going Wrong  I'll give you an example of when I set a financial goal that wasn't a STAR goal and how it ultimately failed.  After I graduated from college and went to graduate school, I really started thinking about retirement. I knew that my IRA would be an important part of my retirement, and I knew that starting retirement savings early would pay massive dividends later on. So, I set the goal of putting aside the maximum allowed amount each year (then $5,000) into my IRA. That was my whole goal. My goal was specific - it was well-defined and gave a particular dollar amount. However, it was not timed, achievable, or realistic. It wasn't timed because I didn't think about how often I would put money aside or how much. It wasn't achievable because I was only making $20,000 pre-tax. If I put $5,000 from my paychecks aside, I would have only had $10,000-$11,000 a year for housing, food, clothing, utilities, etc. Housing and utilities alone were about $8,000 a year. (This was lower-middle class Indiana around 2008.) It wasn't realistic because I did not have a particular way to save money that I could actually stick to.  You might think, well, if he couldn't save $5,000 a year, he probably saved as much as he could. Nope.  To reach my goal, I would have needed to set aside $193 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks, which I simply couldn't do. My brain didn't go to, >well, just save what you can. My brain went to, I can't meet this goal with this paycheck. So, I'll skip it and do it with the next one. Except I didn't. I didn't ever. I occasionally saved money in my IRA - $100 here, $150 there. By the end of my five years in graduate school, I don't think I saved more than $4,000. That's way less than the $25,000 I wanted to save. In hindsight, failing to meet my goals stressed me out. It was easier for me to basically mentally abandon that goal.  What went wrong? My goal was simply impossible with my financial situation at the time. It wasn't a STAR goal. I set my sights too high. My goal should have been, I will save for retirement by depositing $100 from each of my paychecks for the next five years. That I could have managed. It wasn't my first choice of a goal, but it would have been a STAR goal. I could have gotten into a routine of saving that $100 from each check. That would have been $12,000-$13,000 saved by the time I graduated. It doesn't sound like much of a difference from $4,000 in the grand scheme of retiring, but believe me that it does make a huge difference. (We'll explore why in later weeks.)  What should you take from this? Yes, setting financial goals takes work. Yes, sticking to your goal paths takes even more work. But setting unreachable goals and failing to make any progress can be a nasty cycle. A good goal can break you out of those cycles.   "

  "body": " FAQ    What if I don’t agree with the money personality quiz?  The money personality quiz is by no means an official psychological test. It is simply a tool to help you start thinking about how you tend to think about money. The important thing is for you to be honest with yourself about your feelings with regards to finances. You wouldn’t believe the level of mental gymnastics some people go through to rationalize unhealthy financial decisions. Financial decisions are not intrinsically “good” or “bad.” We want to understand why we behave the way we do.    Getting rich quick really isn’t part of financial literacy?  At its most fundamental, financial literacy is about understand financial decisions with your current and predicable financial situation. It isn’t really about sudden expansions in your income stream. Here is the thing about avenues in which some people have obtained vast wealth quickly: For every person who has achieved wealth in a particular way, there are thousands who have tried and failed, often due to luck. Perhaps someone gambled heavily on a volatile stock and won. There are tens of thousands who have tried a similar gamble and lost. For every Internet personality who has gone viral, there are tens of thousands with equal or greater talent who have not gone viral. This is all related to something called “survivorship bias.”    What if I really want to achieve a goal that isn’t at all possible with my current finances?  Honestly, I would not concentrate on that goal for the time being. Some people may argue that an unattainable, lofty goal is good motivation, but I would argue that concentrating on something out of reach will create feelings of disappointment, despair, and frustration. Instead, I would set a goal of expanding your income with the same STAR attributes. Expanding your income may take quite a while, but there are routes to doing so. Once you’re in a situation in which your lofty goal is achievable and realistic, then put your energy (and money) into it.    I just want to learn about finances. What if I don’t care about the psychology stuff?  Life is complicated and difficult. Actions have consequences. I can tell you all the consequences of financial decisions, but that alone won’t turn you into a financial guru. Let’s take smoking as an example. You’ve been told from many different resources that smoking is an action with only negative consequences. Why do some people never smoke once? Why do some people choose to try smoking? Why do some people get addicted? Those questions have different answers for each person. It is the underlying psychology of each person that influence decisions. Given the exact same information, no two people will have the exact same reaction or decision. People can make some really unhealthy financial decisions with life-altering impacts. I am hoping that with some self reflection, you will understand your own urges and impulses and make decisions that are well-informed.    "

Source: https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/ photos\/saving    Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money. Our society makes it really easy for you to buy products or services with little to no thought. One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.   And it's really easy to overspend. Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure? Credit card. Need a flashier car? Payment plan. Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays? Cash advance. (These are not advice for these scenarios. Please don't do them. They're just examples of how easier it is the spend money you don't have.) A budget can be a tool that can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility. A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being. It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.  A budget will help track where your money goes. Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening. Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think. A budget will help you set and achieve STAR goals. By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them. A budget can help payoff your debts or help prevent falling into debt. Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.  Now, I'll tell you the truth. I do not currently set a budget for myself. I used to, but after getting an intuitive sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses. This is not because I'm wealthy. I'm the lowest paid associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system. This is because I set a strict budget for myself that I followed until it became habit. When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean. For most, it doesn't happen overnight. It takes time.  "

  "body": " Budgeting Rules  In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules. There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks. Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.   The 50-30-20 Rule   Here is the rule. Your after-tax income ( take-home pay ) should be allocated so that 50% is spent on needs, 30% is spent on wants, and 20% is saved. That's it. Let's break down these three categories.   Source: https:\/\/www.infinitysolutions.com\/ blog\/do-you-have-trouble-budgeting-try-the-50-30-20-rule\/      Needs - A need is a necessity that you cannot do without. Housing, utilities, food, supplies, insurance, clothing, and transportation are examples of things considered necessities. Other things can definitely be considered needs, based on your individual situation.   Wants - A want is something that you would like to have but isn't strictly necessary for your survival. Eating out, entertainment, coffee, luxury items, and cosmetics are examples of things considered wants.   Savings - A savings item is simply an account in which you put money you do not spend that can be used for the future. Retirement accounts, savings accounts, and swear jars are all examples of things considered to be savings items.   Sounds simple, right? Here is one of the biggest barriers to the 50-30-20 rule. Most people are reluctant to label some desirable items as a want. Thinking to yourself, I couldn't live without coffee, doesn't make it a need. If you live where there is robust public transportation, owning a car may not be considered a need. Pet supplies are tricky. Is owning a pet a necessity? Most people with pets are hesitant to say no. What about Internet access? It may be a necessity, but is the highest speed possible a necessity?   Source: https:\/\/www.afspa.org\/blog\/ the-importance-of-self-care\/     Here is an important truth. If the thought of not having something makes you uncomfortable, that doesn't make the thing automatically a necessity.   Here some examples of things I've heard from people in my life this particular week (at the time I wrote this section):       I just need Taco Bell for my mental health. It's my comfort food.      I couldn't survive without Door Dash.      We can't live anywhere that won't allow the sweets. ( Sweets are her cats. For context, they've been without housing for a year, and this was in response to an opportunity to get into an affordable place.)      Source: https:\/\/scc.sg\/e\/when-self-care-becomes-toxic\/       Activity: Classifying Spending  Let's practice categorizing things as needs, wants, or savings. For each item\/scenario, classify each as a need, a want, or savings. Pick only one. For each, explain your answer in one sentence.     401-k contributions automatically taken from your paycheck.    Going out to dinner after a really stressful week at work.    Car insurance.    Giving an allowance to your child.    Lottery tickets.    Buying stocks.    A Netflix subscription.    Paying for the repair of your refrigerator.    Cleaning supplies.    A limited-edition collector’s item.    The latest Taylor Swift album.    Child-support payments.       Debrief  We're some of these tricky? I hope so. If fact, you may have come up with different answers as others. Some may even depend on the context you imagine. Here are my answers, in order: savings, want, need, want, want, savings, want, need, need, want, want, need.    Allocating Money under the 50-30-20 Rule  Once you can categorize spending, you can get into the actual meat of the 50-30-20 plan. It can be tedious, and it requires you to have a very detailed and realistic record of your spending. Here is the rough steps in creating your budget.     First, determine how much money you make in a month. (You can also do it by week or by paycheck. However, since bills are usually paid monthly, it is best to budget monthly.) Your paycheck will likely be the biggest source of income, but there may be other sources. Any money that you take in counts. Make sure to only count what you actually get (the “net” amount). For example, if you work a job for 40 hours a week at $21 per hour, your weekly pay is . However, that is not what you actually get because of taxes. To simplify things, if you have an annual salary, take that amount and divide by 12 your monthly pay. If you are paid bi-weekly, multiply your paychecks by 2 to get your monthly amount. For weekly paychecks, multiply by 4. If your paychecks vary from check to check, do your best to come up with a monthly average.    Determine how much you can allocate to each category. For needs, we want 50%of your income. So, take your monthly income and multiply by 0.5. For wants, take your income and multiply by 0.3. For savings, take your income and multiply by 0.2. For example, suppose your monthly income is $3,400. Then you can have devoted to needs, devoted to wants, and put into savings.    Make a list of everything you spend money on in a month. You can group things into categories. For example, don’t list out items from the grocery store. Just have one “groceries” item. This is probably the hardest step. Everything counts. Do you buy a mocha only once or twice a week? That’s $20-$40 from your monthly income that you can’t ignore. Be honest with yourself. It may be necessary to look at your credit card bill or debit card statement to really see where and when you spend money.    Categorize your items as needs, wants, or savings.    Add up how much you spend in each category and compare to what amounts you’re allowed. If you over-spend in a category, you may need to change how your finances work, which we’ll go over shortly. Also note that putting too much into savings is not really grounds for alarm. Only if you feel like you’re not enjoying how you’re spending money should you worry about saving too much.     At the end of this section, I've created a budget spreadsheet you are free to use.    The 80-20 Budget Plan  Sometimes, the 50-30-20 plan doesn't work. This is becoming more true for the millennial, Z, and alpha generations as housing costs are increasing more than wages. It is very common to find yourself in a position where you simply can't allocate only 50% of your paycheck to needs. One solution to that is to combine needs and wants into one category in which you allocate 80% of your take-home pay to needs and wants and 20% to savings.  Notice something. This version of the 50-30-20 plan essentially lowers the amount for wants in exchange for needs. It still requires you to save 20%. Generally, you should always prioritize saving over wants. It is vastly more important that you save for unexpected future expenses and retirement rather than spend on things you don't need.  The main benefit of the 80-20 budget is increased flexibility over the 50-30-20.  The increased flexibility of the 80-20 plan does come at a cost. Flexibility allows greater freedom. Greater freedom allows more opportunity to stray from the budget. Simply put, people want wants and do not want to save. It is really easy for the 80-20 plan to become the 100-0 plan. (The 100-0 plan is not a real plan. Please don’t do it.) If you find yourself in a situation where 70%of your paychecks go to necessities like housing, student loans, food, etc., it can be difficult to spend only 10% on stuff you want. Feeling overworked or overstressed can make wants feel like needs.  Under the 80-20 budget plan, you should still classify spending as needs, wants, and savings. it is important for your brain to see that certain spending behaviors are non-essential.    The Envelope System (A.K.A. Cash Stuffing    Source: https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/ about-us\/blog\/budgeting-how-to-create-a-budget-and-stick-with-it\/    One of the most classic budgeting methods is the envelope system. On social media, this is now often called “cash stuffing.” Traditionally, the envelope system requires you to take your entire paycheck in physical cash and allocate that cash into different envelopes for different spending activities. You could have a “rent” envelope, a “student loan” envelope, a “groceries” envelope, a “Dunkin”’ envelope, a “savings” envelope, etc.   Once you distribute your cash, you do your best not to take money from an envelope for any reason other than its intended purpose. For example, don’t take money out of your “groceries” envelope because you want to go out to eat.  This budgeting method is great for people who tend to over-spend on non-necessities. If you find yourself spending money on things you know you shouldn’t, you can try the envelope method. Physically keeping money in labeled envelope can help you see and adhere to your money’s intended purpose. Further, the process of allocating money physically helps you see exactly where your money is going. If you find yourself transferring money from one envelope to another, you are physically seeing that you’re not sticking to your budget.  One big negative drawback of this system is that it requires you to have your money in cash. However, most bills are paid electronically these days. It also requires you to physically go to a bank or ATM to get cash. Further, your paychecks are usually more frequent than billing cycles. So, you have to learn to put parts of needed bill amounts in an envelope with each paycheck. Also, keeping physical cash around your place can be unsafe.  There are some apps available that can help set up a digital “envelope system.” We’ll discuss budgeting apps later in this week’s material.    The Zero-Based Budget   The zero-based budget is a modern update on the envelope system. Under this system, when you get a paycheck, you meticulously give a purpose to every single dollar. So, you do not have just a “savings” category. You would, for example, say “$50 goes into my rainy-day fund. $50 goes into my retire savings. $20 goes into my fund for a vacation.” Beyond paying for your necessities, there are no requirements on how much goes where.   Source: https:\/\/www.bill.com\/ learning\/zero-based-budgeting     The benefit of the zero-based budget is for you to meticulously track your spending. No dollar goes unaccounted. Many people find it helpful in recognizing over-spending habits and starting to save more.  The zero-based budget requires a lot of work and dedication. Have you ever tried tracking calories for even just a week? It's hard and tedious. It's the same thing here. Every dollar you spend needs to be recorded and tracked. Many people are unable to keep up with the recording, which makes this budget useless. Also, some users of this budget method do not increase their savings amounts and instead simple spend their entire paychecks. Ultimately, it is not really a beginner-friendly approach to budgeting unless you have the disciple to stick to it.   "

  "title": "Balancing Your Budget",
  "body": " Balancing Your Budget  Budgeting is a skill that takes time and practice. It is also a matter of psychology. You have to work within the confines of your paychecks and your money personality to create and and adhere to a budget. In this section, we'll look at some ideas in helping you set and maintain a healthy budget.   What to Do When Your Budget Isn't Balanced  Generally, when you are unable to make the 50-30-20 plan, or similar plan, work, it is because your spending habits overpower how much income you have. There are a few things you can do to help get your budget in line.  - First, making more money may be an option. Ask your boss for a raise. Look around for a better-paying comparable job. Take on a small side-gig. You don't necessarily have to throw your arms up and accept not making enough. I know this is easier said than done, but it is a real possibility.   -Suppose you are over-spending in wants. The easiest thing to do is cut back on some of these items that are not essential. Yes, it is uncomfortable saying goodbye to things you get enjoyment from, but it may be necessary. Or perhaps simply altering the want can reduce expenses. For example, going to Chipotle rather than ordering Door Dash will lower that expense. Part of the reason for categorizing things as wants is for you to physically see those things as non-necessities. It can help you make the right, tough decisions.   Source: https:\/\/www.supermoney.com\/12-easy-ways-to-stop-overspending-now     -Suppose you are over-spending in needs but not in other areas. This is fairly common with the current cost of housing. This scenario is tougher, and it is one reason why the 50-30-20 isn’t right for some people. It may require you to make some big changes in your life. Getting a roommate if rent is too high, carpooling to work to save on gas, re-housing a pet to a good home if pet supplies are burdensome, shopping around for better insurance rates, changing Internet providers are all examples changes that could help your needs spending down.  -Suppose you are saving more than 20% of your income. This may not be a bad thing if you are meeting your needs and feel satisfied with how many wants you’re able to fulfill. However, if you are saving so much that you are not paying for your needs or are feeling unsatisfied with what wants you’re able to have, it may be ok to allow yourself to spend more. Of course, depending on your savings goals, saving more than 20%may be a necessary part of the plan.  -If you find yourself over-spending on wants and under-saving, I highly recommend setting up automatic deposits or transfers into a long-term savings account that is separate from your spending\/checking account. This effective forces you to put part of your paycheck aside for savings and giving you a smaller amount to spend each month.    What Not to Do When Your Budget Isn't Balanced   When rent or car insurance comes due, pressure can really mount up and burden you. There are healthy ways to get your budget under control, but there are some things you should avoid.   Source: https:\/\/www.barringtonbhw.com\/ problem-gambling-month\/     -Pay-day loans. Pay-day loans are short-term, high-interest loans. For example, if you’re paychecks are usually $1,000 bi-weekly, the pay-day loan place may give you $900 now in exchange for your $1,000 coming in two weeks. Under that agreement, you are agreeing to a loan with 1448%interest. For context, a mortgage loan is currently around 6%. Here is the real evil about these places. People go to these places because they’re broke and need cash to pay bills immediately. Sacrificing a solid chunk of your paycheck often isn’t really manageable. For example, if you are unable to pay bills with your $1,000 biweekly checks, then how could you do it by giving a pay-day loan place $100 on top of your bills. Many people are able to payback their short-term loan with their paychecks. When this happens, they owe a pay-day loan company money under an extraordinarily-high interest rate that grows exponentially. What you owe becomes completely unmanageable within just a few weeks. Never take out a short-term cash loan (either from a pay-day loan place or a cash-advance on your credit card). Grab a casual job stocking shelves at a local grocer. Call your landlord and explain the situation to try to negotiate a short extension on rent. Sell something you’re not using much. Please don’t resort to a short-term cash loan.  -Gambling and lottery. Just don’t gamble. We’ll discuss the psychology of gambling in a later week, but for now, just acknowledge that gambling is not a valid way to get cash you need to pay bills. You’ll just make your situation worse.    Some Potentially-Risky Ways to Get Relief from Bills  When you need to pay for needs immediately, there are some methods some people turn to. However, these methods can be tricky to navigate and may not be worth it.   -Asking for a personal loan. Here is a life lesson many people don't learn until it's too late. Never loan money to a friend or family unless you are fully prepared never to see that money again. Money complicates relationships. On the borrower side, asking for financial help can put stress on a friendship or relationship. A personal loan \\textit{can} be a potential source of immediate relief with bills, but please reflect deeply on the situation first. It may be better if you look for ways to earn income rather than ask someone for a loan.   Source: https:\/\/www.moneysmartguides.com\/web-stories\/how-to-say-no-family-financial-requests     -Debt consolidation. You have likely seen commercials for debt consolidation. These are for companies you essentially take on your various debts by paying them for you in exchange for regular payments from you. Debt consolidation can be an option if you have a lot of high-interest debt . In that case, you are effectively re-financing your debt at a lower rate. The issue is that many of the companies that advertise this service have predatory tactics. One common one is that in exchange for this service, they tack on a large “fee” to what you owe (on top of the interest they get from you). Another tactic is putting you on a variable interest rate in which you start with a low rate to them, but that rate grows over time. Another tactic is to advertise low monthly payments, but extend the length of those payments drastically. If you find yourself in a great deal of high-interest debt, research ways to lower the interest rate on what you owe. If you cannot refinance a loan, debt consolidation may be a resource. However, please research options carefully. In general, try to go through a local, trustworthy bank rather than a financial institution.    Inconsistent Paychecks  Many people do not have a set salary with near-identical paychecks each week. For example, people who operate their own small business may see different amounts of income month-to-month. Not being able to predict how much you’ll make in future months makes budgeting more challenging. Here are a few ideas to consider when building a budget.  -If possible, try to determine an “average” or “typical” month in terms of income. If you can be fairly sure that, on average, you have a certain amount of money coming in, it is very possible to make a budget. The issue is that in months of higher-than-average income, you have to set the extra money aside as “income” in lower-than-average months. For example, suppose that you determined that, on average, you have $3,000 in income. Let’s say one month you earned $4,000. Then your income for the month is $3,000 that can be used for your needs, wants, and savings. The extra $1,000 is not income for that month. It is set aside, and when you have a month of lower income, say $2,200, you have that saved $1,000 to make up the shortfall. It takes more discipline, but it is definitely manageable.  -Do not consider “bonuses” as part of your regular income. Some jobs pay bonuses at the end of the year. If you start to think of an expected bonus as part of your income, you may find yourself in a tricky situation when a bonus comes in lower than expected (or not at all).  -Even with the best of planning, sometimes someone with inconsistent paychecks find themselves in a long drought of work or productivity. In a circumstance like this, you may want to consider a career change or be willing to do contract work like Uber or Task Rabbit.    Rainy-Day Funds  We’ve mentioned “rainy-day” funds, but we haven’t really talked about them. A “rainy-day fund” is an easily-accessible pot of money that is used for unexpected expenses. Needing to pay for an unexpected large medical insurance deductible, a veterinary bill, or a car-repair bill are all examples of infrequent, unexpected costs that you don’t include explicitly in a monthly budget. A rainy-day fund is a fund to pay for these expenses. Some people refer to their rainy-day fund as a “cushion.”  If you do not have funds available to pay for unexpected bills, you may end up going into debt, which will increase how much you spend each month in bills. It is not recommended to withdraw funds from long-term accounts like retirement accounts for unexpected bills. It is best if you have a separate account for a rainy-day fund.  Generally, it is recommended that a rainy-day fund has about six months worth of necessary expenses. For example, if you determine that a normal month requires around $2,000 in “needs” like rent and food, then you should aim to have rainy-day fund of $12,000. The reasons for this high amount are many. If you lose your job, it can take months to find another one. Veterinary and car bills can range in the thousands of dollars. A lot of life can happen, and it can happen all at once.  It is usually recommended that you start building a rainy-day fund before other kinds of savings. Certainly focus on a rainy-day fund over saving for a vacation. Of course, it is appropriate to put aside money in both a rainy-day fund and a long-term investment fund simultaneously.  One important note is that many people think of a “rainy-day” fund and an “emergency” fund as separate. That is fine. They have the same function - they are both to pay for unexpected bills or costs. The main difference is the amounts in each. I just think of these as one “rainy-day” fund.    Negotiaing Expenses  I was going to include this as a way to help balance your budget, but it is so important that it gets its own little subsection.  Did you know you can negotiate some of your monthly bills?  First, a little background on business in the US. If you ask your parents or grandparents about how much TV cable subscriptions used to be, you’ll find that the costs of these services has grown far more than any other cost in the US, including housing. Most of this rise in cost in nothing but pure profit to the companies. Have you ever wondered why Time-Warner and Comcost never provide service in the same area. (If you live in an area service by Comcast, have you even heard of Time-Warner? Or vice-versa?) That is because they have a back-door agreement not to compete with each other. By not competing, they do not need to compete for your business by offering competitive prices. If you’re thinking that this is a monopoly and shouldn’t be allowed, you’re half right. It’s called an “oligopoly,” which is perfectly legal in the US and forms the foundation of many industries like cable, phone providers, airlines, baby formula, and music. It’s all rather depressing. However, it means that for services like these, companies can offer you their services for much cheaper and still make a hefty profit.  Here is a rule of life. If a company is willing to offer you a product of service at a certain price for a month or year, they can do so again for the next month\/year. (Free-trials are not included.) If your cable company offers you an “introductory rate” for a year, they will be willing to offer it again the next year. Yes, there are exceptions, but it is a good rule to live by. A company would rather make some profit off of your rather than no profit.  Here is how you do it. Simple call or text with a customer service representative and ask to renegotiate your service plan or you will cancel your service. Here are some basic tips.  -If they refuse, continue with canceling. Even if it is something you know you really need\/want to keep, continue with canceling. Often, if they see you’re not bluffing, you’ll get an offer for a lower rate. At worst, you actually do cancel your service. If so, learn to live without the service or simply restart the service. All that would be wasted is a few minutes of your life. (Note that there are some old “grandfathered” plans people have. You may hear some people talk about “YouTube Red” that they’ll never get rid of. I have an old grandfathered plan with T-Mobile that is much better than any other plan I could possibly get these days. Don’t give those up unless you actually want to get rid of the service.)  -Never take the first offer unless its better than what you have. I just recently negotiated my XM radio subscription. It started at $21.99 per month. First offer was $17.99. Second was $7.09. Last was $4.09, which was my “introductory offer.” They won’t take an offer away once they’ve offered it to you.  -Sometimes you can ask to be “treated as a new customer.” That is, ask to have access to introductory rate offered to non-existing customers.  -You can sometimes negotiate a better interest rate on your credit cards, which lowers how much you need to pay each month on them (if you carry a balance). Keep in mind that this sometimes requires a hard credit check, which will lower your credit score. We’ll talk about credit in a later week.  -Rent can be negotiated, to an extent. It never hurts to ask your landlord to negotiate rent. However, in a market such as this one, you’re unlikely to be successful as there will be someone willing and able to pay what you’re paying. On the other hand, you do not always need to put up with large rent hikes. If you find yourself in a situation in which your rent is suddenly increased massively, you may be able to fight it in housing court. (Not civil court.)  Keep in mind that not all bills can be negotiated. Cable, phone, entertainment subscriptions, magazines, are examples of services that can be negotiated. Utilities, groceries, and other consumable products are generally not negotiable.    Activity: Helping Balance a Budget  In preparation for this course, I’ve been scouring Reddit for questions and comments regarding budgeting. Below are some common questions or comments from people. For each, give some suggestions that could be of use to the person.     “How is it even possible to save money when half of it goes just to my rent?”    “Every time I try to budget, I can never get the numbers to add up. I always end up giving up on it.”    “How do you even not spend your whole paycheck? I mean, if I have the cash for Uber Eats, then how am I going to be cooking after work every night?”    “How am I supposed to budget when I have to predict how much I’m going to spend? How am I supposed to know whether I’m going to spend $200 or $1,000 on groceries next month?”    “So, some months I get lots of overtime at my job, but it’s really unpredictable. How can I make a solid budget taking into account my sporadic overtime?”      "

  "title": "Budgeting Tools",
  "body": " Budgeting Tools  Budgeting doesn't have to be with just a notepad and a pencil. There are some great resources to help create a clean and understandable budget.   Paper Tools  For many people, the act of physically writing something can make it more concrete and real. If you are one of those people, doing your budget on paper may be the way to go. At the end of this section, I’ve included a possible monthly budget worksheet that I’ve created. It is one of many possible templates out there. Feel free to print it out if you’d like.  A paper budget is fairly easy in concept. In the respective areas, write down your usual expenses in a month. Don’t include infrequent things like getting a tire repaired. Of course, you can include a “miscellaneous” in either needs or wants (or both). Ultimately, you need to make sure that your expenses, including savings, are no more than your total income for a month. If they are higher, you immediately know that you need to examine your expenses and make some changes. Once you’ve made sure you can afford your proposed month, you should make sure your budget falls in line with your savings goals. Whether it be the 20%or something different, ask yourself if you’re putting enough away for what you want to achieve. If not, you may need to make some changes to get your savings component higher.  The downside to a paper budget is that they are not very secure and it is harder to keep a record of them.    Spreadsheets  As more people brought personal computers into their homes, budgeting on spreadsheets became very common. Any spreadsheet program works. There are even some programs available targeted specifically for budgeting, usually at a cost. I’m using “program” here rather than “app” to include hard-drive bound applications and locally-saved files. I understand that the term “program” is falling out of use. I am partial to Excel as my program of choice, which you can download for free as a Westfield State student.  The nice thing about spreadsheets is that you can “program” them to automatically add-up totals, find percentages, or find differences (among other things). You can also simply type in numbers and calculate what you need to by hand. Ultimately, the process is the same as if you were working on paper. One big benefit is that you can download a spreadsheet file of all your purchases in a month from your credit card account or withdrawals from your bank account and paste them right into your spreadsheet. If you browse Reddit for a while, you’ll find most long-term budget users use spreadsheets over a fancy app.  The downside of spreadsheet programs is the learning curve to some of them. You may need a working knowledge of your program of choice before you can really use them.  I have uploaded two files on Plato for you to look at. One is a blank budget template that you free to use. The other is a simple example what a budget could look like.    Apps  The popularity of budgeting apps has been skyrocketing over the past number of years. They can be as simple or complex as you like. Some even connect to your bank, credit cards, and utilities accounts to automatically update values and make recommendations. One benefit to an app is that for people who do not have the discipline to stick with a spreadsheet month-to-month, an app can make the process more inviting, colorful, and efficient.  Before progressing, a word of caution. As with everything in our connected world, access to services usually comes with security issues. Different apps collect different amounts of your private information. Before downloading any app or connecting something to one of your accounts, do some research into what information is collected and how it is stored and used. Only use a service in which you are comfortable with its information policies. Below, I give a couple of examples of popular budgeting apps. I don’t have a recommendation, and I do not make any claims to their information security policies. This is all informational stuff.  Here is another word of warning, and a life lesson. You’ll notice that most popular budgeting apps are not free, or they have very limited free versions that are barely useful. You’ll also see a price tag well beyond what they’re worth. (As in $10-$20 a month.) Here is why. The target audience of these apps are people who either are new to personal finance or have a history of poor budgeting habits. These companies are hoping to capitalize on this inexperience or lack of confidence. You have to ask yourself if the polish and extra features of a paid app are worth $100-$200 a year for you.  -Goodbudget. Goodbudget uses the envelope method of budgeting. There is a “free” version that limits you to 10 “envelopes” (plus 10 miscellaneous envelopes) and does not connect to your bank. The paid version is either $10 a month or $80 a year. Essentially, you tell Goodbudget how much your paychecks are. You then set up virtual “envelopes” to allocate money. You can also tell it how much debt you have and how you are paying it off (like car loans or credit cards). Goodbudget is more about planning for your next month than it is reflecting on your past expenses. So, if you are looking for insight on why last month’s budget went awry, Goodbudget may not be the best option. The app also has no way of telling when you overspend from an envelope. If you budgeted $250 for groceries but spent $300, you’ll need to update that manually. If you need some help planning and have the discipline to manually enter and keep track of your expenses, Goodbudget may work.  -YNAB. (Used to be “You Need A Budget.” Not it’s “Why-Nab.”) YNAB might be the most polished, and expensive, app available. It is $15 per month or $110 per year. Much of your money goes toward the polish, but that is important for some people. YNAB connects to most bank accounts. If you use your debit card or direct pay for most expenses, YNAB can automatically determine what category each expense falls into. YNAB uses the zero-balance budget method, which asks you to spend or save every dollar of income. It also comes with a bunch of pretty graphs, if that sort of thing excites you. College students can get a one-year “free” trial of YNAB. (“Free” in that you still need to give it billing information that will automatically kick in unless you jump through the hoops to delete your account.) The big claim to YNAB are the educational resources. It gives suggestions on how to allocate your money. (A fancier version of the 50-30-20 rule.)  -PocketGuard. First, PocketGuard costs $75 per year. PocketGuard is a bit different. It is designed more around lowering expenses first and then budgeting afterward. It claims to help detect unnecessary subscriptions and will “negotiate” with certain companies for better rates. (E.g., a better monthly rate for Internet.) It connects to most of your financial accounts including your bank, credit cards, loan providers, etc. The budgeting aspect is fairly basic. After your automatic monthly expenses are deducted, you build your budget manually around it. It can auto-categorize expenses from your bank or credit card statements. I do NOT recommend “trying” PocketGuard to see if it lowers your bills. You will be charged $75 and locked into a subscription whether or not it actually does what it claims.   Again, please be careful with these apps . Whether it be becoming locked into a paid subscription or giving access to your financial information, these apps exist for the companies’ benefit. Your benefit is secondary to them. Do research and make informed decisions.   "

  "title": "FAQ",
  "body": " FAQ    Does a budget like the 50-30-20 budget apply to students?  A budget plan is simply a guide for how to manage money and are not concrete things. Numbers can be changed to adapt to certain situations. Some students choose to work just enough to pay for college expenses, and that’s ok. A budget is meant to help you gain and maintain financial stability. If you’re in a situation where you still have most of your expenses paid for by your parents, then the numbers involved may look different. Perhaps you could save more than 20% of money you earn?    Do I need to spend 50%of my money on needs?  No. First, a budget is simply a tool for helping you achieve and maintain financial health. It is not a law of the world. Think of the 50-30-20 rule more as a guideline in which you should aim so that no more than 50% of your income goes to needs and no more than 30% goes to wants.    How do taxes play a role in budgeting.  For the majority of people in the US, taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. So, you do not need to budget for taxes. You base your budget on your after-tax or take-home amount. So, after your taxes have been removed, you build your budget around what you get post-taxes.    Should I learn how to avoid taxes?  No. That’s called “tax evasion.” Taxes pay for education, roads, law enforcement, parks, sanitation, etc. Taxes are necessary for maintaining the benefits of living in a country like the US. There are legitimate ways to reduce what you pay in taxes, which we’ll cover in a later week.    How does insurance play a role in budgeting?  For most types of insurance, you factor insurance into your budget as a need. The tricky one is medical insurance. If you get medical insurance through your employer, you likely pay a part of the premium (usually 25%) out of your paycheck automatically. You have a choice with this. If possible, you could think of that automatic insurance premium payment like a tax and use your post-tax, post-insurance pay for budgeting. However, you can also include the premium payment as a need. In that case, you would need to add what you pay in insurance premium to your after-tax pay amount and then build your budget, including medical insurance as a need. For example, if your after-tax pay is $2,000 each month and insurance is $200 each month (making your paychecks total $1,800), you could take $1,800 as your money used for budgeting, basing percentages off $1,800 and not including medical insurance in the budget. You could also take $2,000 as your pay (even though you only get paychecks totaling $1,800) and base percentages off that, but you need to make sure that the $200 is listed as a need in your budget.    How do I stop my bank account from going negative?  If you can, pretend that $0 isn’t a balance of $0. Make a mental note that some amount, say $100, is effectively $0. That is, if you see your account approaching $100, you tell yourself you are out of money and can no longer spend until you have more. The more you earn\/spend as life goes on, you’ll want that minimum number to be higher. Note that this minimum amount is different than a rainy-day or emergency fund.    How do I get rich by making a budget?  A budget isn’t about accumulating wealth. It is about getting and maintaining financial health. The savings component of a budget will help with accumulating long-term savings or retirement, but it is not a way to get rich quick. However, sticking to a budget can help you get rich slow and steady, or at least help lift yourself out of poverty.    There are some things I label as wants, but I can’t go a day without them. What should I do?  If you find yourself in a situation where you need to cut back on wants but your brain is really driving you to keep buying a certain thing, you may be looking at an addiction. It may be worth talking with someone at the Counseling Center about getting some tips to cut back.    "

  "body": " Homework for Week 2    Be sure the following activities are turned in (if you have not already submitted them):     Classifying Spending    Helping Balance a Budget       Below is the current budget for Anita Budget. Her goal is to save at least 20% of her income. She is currently single, living in a 2-bedroom apartment, owns two cats. She has already asked her boss for a raise, and she hasn’t been able to find a better-paying job. First, correct any errors in categorization for Anita. Second, make recommendations for how she can get her budget under control and achieve her savings goals .        Below is the current budget for Max Spender. He wants to enjoy more from life while also saving for retirement and education. So, he would like to spend no more than 50%on necessities. He is married with two children. He works full-time, and his husband works part-time as the primary care-giver. Max has already asked his boss for a raise, and he cannot change careers right now. Make recommendations for how Max can reach his budget goals.         For this exercise, you will make your own monthly budget. First, list out all our expenses and savings and classify them as needs, wants, and savings . If there are any items you want to keep personal and don’t want me to see, just list it as “personal expense,” but still give the actual monthly amount that personal item costs. Second, create your budget using whatever budget plan and technique you’d like, except for an app. (You may still use an app to budget, but in terms of submitting your budget for this assignment, an app would be a bit tedious.)  You have two options. If you have a job, either full-time or part-time, and have some of your own expenses that you pay for, you can use your actual paychecks and expenses to create your budget. If you do not currently work, you may create a hypothetical budget using income and expenses you might expect shortly after graduation. (If you do this hypothetical budget, research how much the starting pay is for a job you could see yourself doing just after graduation. Don’t use “average pay.” Also research realistic expenses in terms of housing, food, etc. For your pay, take how much is reported for a starting pay and multiply by 0.7. This will give you an approximate after-tax amount.)    We targeted four learning objectives this week: life-long learning, metacognitive reflection, accessing welling tools, and social-emotional skills. For each of the learning goals, write a few sentences as to how this week’s material has helped you progress toward meeting those learning objectives. The four learning goal descriptions are as follows:     Lifelong Learning: Students practice skills and attitudes central to lifelong learning; including a growth mindset that encompasses self-reflection, flexibility, intellectual curiosity, and considers broad perspectives and diversity of thought.    Metacognitive Reflection and Application: Students reflect on their own wellbeing in the context of the course topic and develop metacognitive reflection abilities that work to promote transfer of wellness behaviors and skills.    Accessing Wellness Tools: Students develop tools for improving their physical, social, and\/or mental\/emotional health and overall college experience.    Social Emotional Skills: Students identify personal social, emotional, and cognitive skills to be practiced and developed; including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, responsible decision making, relationship skills, and communication skills.

  "body": " An Introduction to Credit  Let’s look at a few very realistic scenarios.  Alex and Alexa are in the market for their first home. A clean, updated home in a nice neighborhood has just gone on the market for $300,000. They have saved for a 20%downpayment plus closing costs. So, they need to borrow $240,000. Banks are currently advertising 5.8%30-year fixed rates. This would make the basic mortgage cost $1,408 per month. With taxes and insurance, their monthly mortgage payment is $2,074. This amount would just fit into their possible housing budget. When they apply for the loan, they are told that their credit is not great and that the interest rate is going to be 7.2%. This change in interest rate raises the basic loan payment to $1,629, a $221 difference. Alex and Alexa could move a little around in their budget, but not $221. They decide to leave off on buying a home for a few more years.  Jordan was laid off from work for a number of months during a recession, but they have have just accepted a new job in Boston. They don’t have a car and need to live somewhere with decent public transportation options to downtown. They have been putting in applications for several apartments, but they are rejected every time. They are told that tenants with better credit ratings are the ones chosen to rent the places. During their unemployed time, Jordan had to miss a number of bill payments, but they are starting to catch up. No landlord is willing to accept their explanation of their situation and choose to just “go with the numbers.” Jordan has to now choose between not taking her new job or living in a place in which the daily commute is hours long.  The two scenarios above are not particularly wild or extreme. In fact, they are very common. Having poor credit can cost you in terms of money, time, and stress. The importance of credit has become so mainstream that an entire industry has been built around it.  When you hear the term “credit” in the context of personal finance, it refers to a measurement on how trustworthy you are with regards to paying your bills and paying back loans you take out. Giving someone a loan is a risky thing. If someone is unable to pay what they owe you, it can be a very time-consuming endeavor to recuperate even part of the money you are owed. If you are a landlord, it can take 6 to 18 months to evict someone who stops paying rent. So, landlords tend to only rent to those who have shown they can and will pay their bills. Some insurance companies even demand more in monthly premiums to someone with more risky bill-payment history. Some employers may check your credit as well as a gauge of how “responsible” you are. So, it is paramount to your financial health to build and maintain “good credit.”   How Credit is Measured  There are two measurements of your credit. The first measurement is your credit report . In actuality, you have a number of credit reports. Each “reporting bureaus” has their own report. The three biggest reporting bureaus are TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. These credit reports give a snapshot of your current and recent experiences in loan and bill payments. When you apply for a loan or some other thing that requires a “hard inquiry” into your credit, lenders will look at this credit report to make a decision. A credit report will list things like, how much you still owe on your house\/car, what your current monthly payments on loans are, credit card balances, credit card limits, bankruptcies, financial lawsuits, previous credit inquiries, and which monthly payments you have made on time.  The second option of credit measurement is a credit score . A credit score is simply a single number that summarizes your credit. The larger the score, the better. Each reporting bureau can use its own method and scale for credit scores. There used to be more difference in possible ranges for credit scores, but most models now put all credit scores between 350 and 850. The point of a credit score is to give a somewhat-universal measurement of credit that shouldn’t open any more doors to biases in decisions regarding loans.   "
