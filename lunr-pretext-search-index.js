  "body": " Welcome to Money and You!  Welcome to Money and You! I am thrilled that you are part of my course. I hope that this course will end up being one of your most useful in your undergraduate curriculum. Understanding personal finance and how you think and act about money can benefit you in a number of ways.  Money and You is a twist on a traditional personal finance course. Over the semester, you will learn the fundamentals of managing your money, which you will be able to use for the rest of your life. You will learn techniques for setting a budget; why and how to build credit; the process, benefits, and drawbacks of buying a home; the world of insurance; taxes as they apply to you; loans and debt; car-buying; scams; saving for retirement; using modern finance tools; and setting financial goals.  The twist on this course is the opportunity to reflect on how you (individually) behave around and think about money. You will develop techniques to manage stress about money, explore how money can affect your relationships, reflect on why you want certain things, explore your feelings about risk and reward, and consider why long-term financial goals can be difficult without the proper mindset.   What this course is not   This course is not a how to get rich quickly lesson. It is more of a how to accumulate wealth slowl course. Let's just get this out of the way now. If there were a proven track to move into the upper class, it wouldn't be some secret that is easily divulged in a self-help book or class. The course is about setting and achieving realistic and manageable financial goals.   Source: https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/the-way-to-get-rich-quick-is-to-do-it-slowly-3d102cfbea9d     This course is not a course on investment techniques. We will cover how to save for retirement, which can involve investing, but we will not explore specific investment strategies like picking particular stocks or trying to predict the crypto market. We will explore what finance experts do with their own money and why. We will explore general strategies for saving. We will not make any speculations or bets on particular investment opportunities.  Cards on the table, I am a professor of mathematics. However, this course is not a mathematics course. Of course, there will be numbers since money is a quantitative object. You will not need to memorize complex formulas. You will need to be able to understand some arithmetic and how to apply arithmetic in the context of some applied problems, but you will have access to pretty much all computational tools you would like.   Source: https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/dogbert-s-get-rich-quick-scheme-is-scam-FzCOthK      Course Norms  Let's talk about the expectations and norms for this class.    Source: https:\/\/www.edutopia.org\/blog\/ establishing-classroom-norms-todd-finley    First and foremost, everyone should feel welcome and included in this class. Each of us comes into this class with different experiences, identities, ideas, and social positions. You can expect of me to foster an environment in which you can reach your academic goals. I will expect of you, in-turn, to participate in that learning environment and contribute positively to other's learning. Contributing positively to the learning environment means the following expectations (among others):      Everyone is allowed to exist as themselves. Harassing, dismissive, violent, disrespectful, or discriminatory rhetoric\/behavior is not allowed. You are allowed to be who you are. Give that same freedom to others. It is ok to disagree. It is not ok make someone else feel less valuable. I reserve the right to request students who engage in such behavior be removed from the course. If you feel that something I have said in our class space does not support your right to be yourself, please let me know.    Let's do it. Let's talk about AI. No college course is about you turning some pieces of paper that say the right thing for college credit. It is about learning what you need to succeed in your career, becoming an educated and compassionate citizen, and learning how to formulate your own ideas and communicate them effectively. I am not opposed to you using AI appropriately . Here is the general rule for this course: AI should not be used to generate ideas. Use it to correct your grammar. Use it to delve deeper into a topic you want to know more about. Do NOT ask AI to write out a solution or submission for any assignment. This includes just using it to check an answer. Your submitted assignments should be a representation of how you connect with the material. Using AI inappropriately will be considered a violation of the University's Academic Honesty Policy. If you have any questions about appropriate AI use, please let me know.      Source: https:\/\/www.kent.edu\/today\/news\/adding-ai-cheating-and-plagiarism-policy       I understand that life happens. Sometimes, unexpected things require us to focus on other things. I will keep this in mind regarding attendance and assignment submission. However, I will expect honest, timely, and open communication. If a major event happens that may affect your ability to complete an assessment on time, let me know ahead of time so we can work something out. Poor communication or ghosting the course are harder things to be flexible about.    Feel safe but avoid safetyism. Safetyism is an obsession with eliminating or avoiding threats (even imaginary ones) to such an extent that you are unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs or accommodations necessitated by practical or moral concerns. It is the belief that it is unhealthy to experience negative emotions. In order to learn, you need to struggle a bit. No one is a master of everything. It's ok to feel confused. It's ok to be disappointed. It's ok to think about things that are a bit uncomfortable. A big part of this course will be reflecting on how you relate to money. I'll tell you now, you're going to have a lot of negative emotions regarding finances over your life. This course will help you prepare for those emotions, but you need to be willing to really think and explore your own mind. Don't withdraw from challenge. Don't hide from life.      "

I'm not promising to answer everything. (I won't tell you what stocks to buy.) But please ask about things you are genuinely interested in.    Activity: Money personality quiz   We all have different ways in which we relate to money. Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil. Some adore or worship money and wealth. Some are very indifferent to money.   Source: https:\/\/www.bankatfirst.com\/personal\/ discover\/flourish\/money-personalities.html     We all have different ways in which we relate to money. Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil. Some adore or worship money and wealth. Some are very indifferent to money. No relationship to money is the right one or the wrong one. However, how you think about money absolutely influences your life, both day-to-day and long term. Setting financial goals is important, but if you try to set goals while ignoring your connection to money, you are likely setting yourself up for failure.  You are going to take a short quiz. There are no right answers. There are points assigned to different options, but points are not necessarily a good thing or bad thing. For each question, do not answer as if anyone will look at these because no one will. Do not answer based on what you think is the most socially acceptable. Really think about each question and be comfortable selecting the answer that best describes you. Please note that this is not an official test. It is just meant to get you to start thinking about your own connection to money.      I would be better off if I had more money.

Money Worshipper. A money worshipper often equates wealth with success or status. They tend not to be shy or anxious regarding finances. They believe that money is an important part of their connection to society. A money worshipper can be either a saver or a spender, but is usually a spender. Positive traits of a money worshipper is that they may have the motivation to work harder to accumulate wealth and may be more charitable. Possible pitfalls of a money worshipper include over-spending, amassing debt, having an unhealthy money fixation, and relationship stresses. Being too much of a money worshipper may mean a belief that accumulating wealth and status supersedes morality or ethics.   Money Avoider. A money avoider tries to avoid thinking or talking about financial issues. The topic of money can make them feel anxious. Sometimes, a money avoider equates wealth with lower morals. The potential benefits of being a money avoider can include making ethical decisions without the influence of money. Unfortunately, avoidance has many pitfalls including a reluctance to budget or plan financially. They may tend to over-rely on others for getting basic needs. A money avoider may also experience relationship stresses regarding finances.   Money Saver. A money saver is more future-oriented and prefers to accumulate money to prepare for the future. The benefits of being a saver include understanding the importance of being financially-prepared, a willingness to budget, and being prudent. The potential pitfalls of being a money saver include becoming a miser or overly-cynical of spending. They may over-stress on finances and refuse to engage in practical spending.   Money Spender. A money spender is more present-oriented and tends to use the money they have rather than save it for later. The benefits of being a spender include being willing to engage in more self-care and being more open to a variety of events or experiences that cost money. Pitfalls include over-spending, lacking discipline to adhere to a budget, and relationship stresses.   Money Indifferent. Someone who is money indifferent does not feel excited or anxious about money. People who are money indifferent generally are either wealthy enough to never have to worry about money, or they have adopted an out of sight - out of mind mentality. Not many people truly fit into this category. Most people get either anxious or excited about money, but they may test into this category if they do not answer truthfully about certain scenarios. Those truly indifferent to money may have an easier time navigating relationships as money is less important to them. However, they may also avoid necessary financial planning.   Source: https:\/\/blog.bankbazaar.com\/ what-type-of-money-personality-are-you\/     There are also some hybrid personalities.'   Money Status. A person who is both a money worshipper and money spender tend to focus on accumulating outward-facing symbols of wealth. They may prioritize buying an expensive car rather than investing their money. They may work very diligently to accumulate wealth. However, they may take on too much risk and may make dangerous social comparisons.   Money Vigilant. A person who is both a money avoider and money saver may be money vigilant. Someone who is money vigilant can be anxious or guarded around topics of personal finance. Benefits include a willingness to save and budget, not overspending on luxury items, and overall prudence. Pitfalls can be becoming a miser or over-stressing about finances.   Money Monk. A person who is both a money avoider and money spender may be a money monk. Someone who is a money monk can feel guilty when they have money. They do not like talking about money, but they are willing to work for it. They tend to spend much of their money on others. Benefits can include less stress in personal relationships and having a charitable spirit. Pitfalls include overspending and being unwilling to save for the future.   Money Hoarder. A person who is both a money worshipper and money saver may be a money hoarder. A money hoarder appreciates wealth and equates it to status. However, they do not outwardly display wealth to others. The benefits of being a money hoarder is a willingness to budget and save for the future. Pitfalls can include refusing to spend on things important for their health and having trouble navigating relationships.  As an example, here are my results: (1,F); (2,A); (3,B); (4,E); (5,E); (6,B); (7,B); (8,E); (9,E); (10,B); (11,B); (12,F); (13,F); (14,D); (15,A); (16,B); (17, B); (18, F); (19, E); (20,E).  So, my point allocation would be: Money Worshipper - 1 point. Money Avoider - 7 points. Money Saver - 7 Points. Money Spender - 5 Points. Money Indifferent - 2 Points.  My dominant personality types seem to be a Money Avoider and a Money Saver. I could then label myself as being money vigilant.     Debrief  What should you take away from this activity? As you explore personal finance and start planning for your present and future, you need to work with yourself. Working against yourself will make financial planning difficult and stressful. For example, if you are a money spender and do not accept that part of your personality, saving and budgeting will be much harder for you. You may find yourself asking, why can't I stop buying X? . If you can identify your relationship to money, it will help you assess what you already do well and what you need to work on.  You cannot change the entire world's connection to money. You cannot change someone else's relationship to money. You can only work on yourself. By understanding how you think about and use money, you can become more mindful of all the emotions that money can bring and be more prepared for them. You want to make sound, prudent decisions about money that will work toward your personal financial goals. You need to truly know yourself to make these decisions.   "

  "body": " Money Psychology  At the end of the day, financial well-being is large a product of the decisions we make with our money. Knowing all about the world of finance the consequences of decisions is not enough to maintain financial health. You must also know why you make the decisions you do. Having an understanding of yourself will help you keep on making sound financial decisions and avoid poor ones.   Money Personality  You have seen a glimpse of money personality and have thought about your own. Your money personality shapes your beliefs and values regarding your finances (and even the whole financial world). These beliefs and values directly affect how you think about money. For example, suppose you have $10,000 saved into an account. A person who is a saver will likely value security over spending and would be more inclined to continue saving or investing that money. A money worshipper may value financial status and be more inclined to spend the money on something like a down payment for a fancy car. A money spender may value exciting experiences and see that money as an international vacation.  The point is that it helps to know yourself around money. Suppose you have that $10,000 and \\textit{know} you shouldn't spend it, but you find yourself unable to stop thinking about all you could buy with it. Realizing that your money personality may drive you more toward spending can allow you to be more mindful of your feelings. Realize that your feelings are not wrong. Feel your feelings. But go with what you know is the best option for you. With practice, this becomes easier and easier.    Money Biases   Everyone is unique, right? Well, some aspects of money psychology are so common that there are names for them. In fact, many advertisements and salespeople utilize some of these aspects to manipulate you into spending your money. We'll discuss these tactics when we explore scams and manipulation.   Source: https:\/\/www.tataaia.com\/blogs\/life-insurance\/10-biases-investors-should-keep-in-mind-when-conducting-investments.html     Generally speaking, a bias is a thought, opinion, practice, etc. that is so imbedded in your brain that it affects your behavior without you realizing it. A bias is not as simple as I like X better than Y. They are subtle, but powerful. Most people are unaware of their biases until those biases are confronted. Even then, many people choose not to accept their own biases. We will go through some of the most common financial biases.   Society Bias. Have you ever thought about needing the latest model of a phone, even though yours still works fine? Is it the extra 26 minutes of battery life? Is it the extra 0.4MP resolution on the camera? No. It's about status. Cellular phones and smartphones have been symbols of status since their creation. (Seriously, look at who bought the first cellular phones in the 80's.) Status symbols can drive many of us to make purchases that stretch our budgets. Many people buy the largest homes their budgets can possibly afford when a smaller one would be just as functional. Many people dine at expensive restaurants mostly for the opportunity to post a photo of their meal to social media. Similarly, some people buy the latest smartphones so that they can have the largest number available.    Endowment Effect. The endowment effect is less about buying and more about selling. Have you ever run a garage sale (or tag sale for you New Englanders) or tried to sell a car of phone? That feeling you get when you are offered a price less than what you feel is owed is the endowment affect. An interesting commonality in human psychology is that once we own an item we feel as though it is worth more.   Source: https:\/\/customercamp.co\/endowment-effect\/     Imagine this scenario. You buy a car that has a value of $25,000. However, the second you sign the paperwork and own the car, the car's value drops to $20,000 because the car now has a previous owner and has depreciated. How does that make you feel? Are you feeling, Oh, that totally makes sense that my car is worth less ? Or are you feeling, That's bull. If I haven't driven the car, it's still worth what I paid for it ? Probably the latter. The thing with the endowment effect is that it can cause people to hold onto items that they really want to sell. Rather than earning some cash on an item you want to sell, you get no money and need to keep owning your item.    Loss Aversion. One of the workers behind the endowment affect is loss aversion, but loss aversion is a mental bias all its own. In general, people prefer to avoid losing money rather than making gains. Don't believe me? Think about this scenario. You can play a game. You have a 75% chance of winning it. If you win, you double your life savings. If you lose, you lose all your life savings. Do you play the game?   Source: https:\/\/cognitivebias.io\/bias\/loss-aversion     From a mathematical standpoint, the answer is clearly yes! However, most people will not take that bet because of loss aversion. Loss aversion has the potential to make you miss out on financial opportunities and investment gains. Now, a 25% chance of losing your life savings is a bit extreme, but loss aversion can affect much smaller financial decisions. Here's a common example with stocks. When investors see a good gain in a day, they are happy but not shocked. However, when a loss of a similar magnitude happens, the feeling of that loss hits much harder. Many investors will then pull their money out of investments when they see a sudden loss. However, selling a stock when it hits a low is generally not a good idea. (On the other hand, some stocks will continue to decline, and investors may choose not to sell due to loss aversion.)    Anchoring Bias. Here is a huge one that is the foundation of a lot of advertising schemes. (We'll dig in more later as to how.) Anchoring bias is now closely tied to the idea of a sale or deal. Seeing a product being offered for a price less than it was originally can make us want to buy that product, regardless of whether it is worth that much.   Source: https:\/\/thedecisionlab.com\/biases\/anchoring-bias     Do you notice that sale tags always tell you the price before the sale. It's to trigger your anchoring bias. There is a lot to discuss regarding manipulation and anchoring, but that will come in a later unit. For now, be aware that this bias exists. When making decisions on what to buy, do not concentrate on what was. Concentrate on what is. It doesn't matter that the pack of Oreos is usually $4 and is $3 today. Were you going to buy Oreos anyway? Is $3 the price you're willing to pay?  Now, do not think that buying something that is on sale is anchoring bias and should be avoided. That certainly isn't the case, and shopping sales can help with staying on a budget. Anchoring bias is wanted to buy something simply because it is marked on sale. If you regularly buy yarn because you are an avid knitter and wait until yarn is on sale to buy it is an example of better control of money. When you're out shopping for a new belt and see shirts are marked on sale and decide to now buy some shirts, that is likely anchoring bias influencing you.   Present Bias. It is usually easier to concentrate on what you're feeling now compared to what you may feel in the future. Present bias is the concept of living in the present. Living in the present is great for mindfulness, but it can be detrimental to making future plans. Living too much in the present can cause overspending on things you want now rather than saving for the future. Of course, it isn't good to live totally in the future and become a miser. Working with your present bias takes practice and hard work. Your brain is hard-wired to want what you want now. Delaying gratification for a much stronger sense of happiness takes conscious effort. Try to get into the habit of asking what you're giving up by spending money now. By buying the latest model phone now instead of skipping a generation, what financial goals or milestones are you delaying? By ordering that doughnut at Dunkin', what nutritional goals are you giving up? You do not need to sacrifice everything that makes you happy, but you need to have an eye toward the future. Your future self will thank you.   Confirmation Bias. Have you ever scoured the Internet looking for opinions to help you make an important decision? Often, people find a scenario in which most of the information tells them not to make a certain choice, but they only really accept the small bit of information that supports making that choice. This is confirmation bias at work.    Source: https:\/\/qualityedge.com\/articles\/ confirmation-bias\/    Here's an example (not really financial). I am currently debating whether to get surgery on my spine to help with neurological pain. I've been debating this surgery for three years. When I have particularly bad flare-ups, I look for people's opinions and experiences with the surgeries. I find myself much more likely to read stories of successes rather than warnings or bad experiences.   This is likely because that main pain has made me unconsciously decide to get the surgery, and I am looking for confirmation of that opinion. Confirmation bias pops up constantly when making financial decisions. If you find yourself looking at information and only clicking on certain articles, posts, or sites, there is likely confirmation bias at work. It is important to remain objective as you make important decisions and accept all credible information as credible.  Just as a point of reference. Confirmation bias exists everywhere. It is one of the cornerstones of racism, conspiracy theories, homophobia, tribalism, etc. It is a really, really strong bias that every person on this earth has. Being more aware of it can help you make decisions that are actually in your own interest rather than making poor decisions and mentally-manipulating what you see to confirm that poor decision.   Affinity Bias. Related to confirmation bias is affinity bias. Affinity bias can be thought of as brand loyalty that can cause some inefficient financial decisions. For example, many adults ignore cheaper store-brand items in grocery stores (or even refuse to try shopping at a place like Aldi's); they instead only purchase items from brands they recognize. Sometimes there may be sound reasons for this restriction, but often the differences are minimal. For example, many store brand items are actually manufactured in the same factory as name-brand ones. The only difference is packaging.  Affinity bias doesn't have to be objectively bad. Many people make conscious efforts to support or not support certain businesses or products. For example, many people refuse to shop at Walmart, despite it being cheaper, because they do not support the low wages paid to employees or the forced closures of small businesses. What is important is for you to be aware of affinity bias and make conscious choices that fit with your preferences and financial goals.    Herd Mentality. Very much related to social bias is herd mentality. You have likely heard of it before. It's the thing everyone says people different from them follow and is what hipsters claim to be immune to. We are all under the effect of herd mentality. It's easy to see when other people are following a herd, particularly when we don't like that particular herd. It is much harder seeing when you are following a herd.   Source: https:\/\/tecnosoluciones.com\/ marketing-by-influencers-what-is-it-and-how-to-handle-it-correctly\/?lang=en     The consequences of herd mentality in the financial world (and beyond) are many. Herd mentality can cause you to buy something you really don't need or even convince you that you do need an item. It can cause investors to buy stocks that have been on the rise right before a bubble burst. In the modern world, the two most prevalent sources of herd mentality are in rating systems and influencers. Did you most recipe ratings online are fake? Did you know most Amazon reviews on a product are not for the actual product you're interested in? Yet they're important factors in determining our behavior. Speaking as someone who grew up before social media, I cannot tell you how bonkers I find the idea of watching an influencer. Yet followers beget more followers, which is the very concept of herd mentality.    Activity: Think About Your Biases  Pick three of the biases above that you have experienced in some way. (If you think you haven't been influenced by these biases before, think harder.) For each bias, briefly describe a time when that bias affected your thinking or behavior. Briefly reflect on how being mindful of those biases could lead (or have led) to better decisions.    Debrief  One thing to notice is that thinking about weaknesses in the way we think is difficult. That's because of the biggest bias of all - self-bias. We trust our own thoughts more than ones that conflict with them. That's ok; it's part of being human. However, like it or not, biases affect your behavior. Some may be more prone to certain biases than others, but bias is part of the human condition. From a financial standpoint, learning to recognize your own biases can help you make more informed and beneficial decisions about your money.   "

  "body": " Setting Financial Goals   I'm willing to bet you have some financial goals already. Maybe you want to buy a house one day. Maybe you're already thinking about how to retire. Maybe you want to save up for the next Taylor Swift concert. If you have financial goals already, that's great. If not, that's okay too.   Source: https:\/\/www.signaturebankga.com\/ financial-goals-every-small-business-and-entrepreneur-should-have\/      Activity: Preliminary Financial Goals  Before we dive into setting good financial goals, I want you to physically write out at least two financial goals that you have. No restrictions.    STAR Financial Goals  Here is the thing about most financial goals. They usually fail. It's unfortunate, but true. The reason for failure usually isn't bad luck or an economic downturn. Most financial goals are doomed from the start. This is because most financial goals are vague and have no realistic plan behind them. Maybe a financial goal of yours is to be able to buy a house. It is a nice enough goal, but it is vague with no plan. When do you want to buy the house? How will you save up for it? Is your plan realistic?  A good financial goal need to have certain characteristics. We'll use saving for a home as an example.   Specific. A financial goal can't be vague. It needs to be specific. Suppose you would like to buy a house? Depending on the size, location, and type of house you may want, the finances involved will vary wildly. You'll need a down payment, which can be (maybe possibly) as low as 3.5%, but preferably 20%, of the house's value. Maybe the kind of home you're interested in will be worth about $300,000 by the time you buy it, and you want a 15% down payment. Then your more specific goal is, I want save $45,000 as a down payment to buy a home. This goal is specific.   Timed. Your financial goal should have timing to it. In how long will you achieve your goal? How often will you perform a necessary action to work toward that goal? If your goal is to save $45,000 for a down payment, then ask when will I have that $45,000? and how often will I put money aside for it? For example, you could say, I want to save $45,000 to buy a home in ten years by saving $400 each month.    Achievable. Your financial goal should be achievable. That is, it should possible given your current financial situation. Your goal should not bank on the hope that you will land a seven-figure job. Setting a goal of owning a private island is likely not achievable for anyone in this class without some huge inflow of resources. (Did reading that sentence trigger any emotions in you? Make note, if so.) You cannot simply say, Well, I'll get a job that pays millions. You need to be honest about your limitations. The key question is, What can you manage right now ? Buying an island isn't very likely or reasonable. On the other hand, buying a home is achievable. About two-thirds of Americans live in a home owned by the occupants. (Note that this is not saying that two-thirds of people or families own their homes!)  Consider the goal of saving $400 each month for a house down payment. The question is whether this goal is achievable or not, given the person's current financial situation. If not, the goal may need to be altered, or you may need to change your current financial situation.   Realistic. Similar to being achievable, financial goals need to be realistic. Being realistic includes being abstractly achievable, but it also includes making the saving process more tangible. What I mean is that, for example, saving $400 each month may be well within the realm of being possible or achievable. However, realistically, how will you do it? Perhaps, your goal could be, I want to save $45,000 for a down payment on a home in ten years by saving $200 from each of my biweekly paychecks. Depending on your situation, this may or may not be realistic. If not, can you change some numbers to make it realistic? Maybe the goal could be, I want to save $50,000 for a down payment on a house in fifteen years by saving $135 from my biweekly paychecks.     Activity: Setting STAR Financial Goals  Now is your time to practice. Come up with two financial goals that are specific, timed, achievable, and realistic. They do not need to be lofty like buying a house, but they certainly can be.    Debrief  I want you to notice something about what you may be feeling after thinking about financial goals. If you started thinking about what you can realistically do to save money, you likely started feeling stressed. That is okay. In fact, setting financial goals is usually stressful. However, stress is not always bad. (Look up eustress. ) There are a couple reasons for this stress.   First, a financial goal means you can't have what you want now , and that's tough in today's modern society. Everything can be delivered to your door in 2 days. International trade allows for items to be manufactured at extremely low prices. Our society is built around getting what we want immediately.   Source: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/how-manage-financial-stress-anxiety-nonjabulo-sikhakhane     It's stressful to confront the very real fact that you can't always get what you want right away (or ever in some cases). (If you want some context for relatively-recent history of buying stuff, ask your parents or grandparents about ordering from the Sears catalog.) It is important that you learn to confront this stress. The more you practice accepting that some goals take time and effort to achieve, the better you will become at achieving them. It's not a simple thing to do, but it does get easier with practice.  Most financial goals require you to save. Honestly, saving money stinks. Saving money means you have less to spend, which means you need to make some sacrifices in regards to what you buy. For example, one long-term STAR goal I have is to save for my retirement by putting aside the maximum allowed contribution (currently $7,000 a year) into my IRA by depositing $270 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks. It's a good goal, but that goal means I have about $540 each month that I can't spend. Thinking about what I could do with an extra $7,000 each year is stressful. However, with the right mindset and some discipline, I accept that my financial goal takes priority over that extra spending money. Here is one tip. Do not think of saving as a sacrifice. If feasible, think of it as part of your regular budget - something that you need to do with each paycheck. Commit to it with a concrete plan and stick with it. It doesn't take long until saving is a habit.  Perhaps some of you began to actually worry about practically working toward your goals. This may be a sign that your goal isn't achievable or realistic. When a goal requires you to save, the goal should be one that is within your power to work toward. If your goal is too lofty or requires too much financial compromising, you won't be able to stick to it. Remember that it is always better to make slower, healthy progress than fast, unsustainable progress. Burnout is very real.  This debrief is not meant to make you feel stress. It is to help you be mindful of any stress you may feel. Stressing over finances doesn't mean you're goals are bad, and it is okay to feel some stress over them. Work with that stress to formulate and follow STAR goals.    Example of a Goal Going Wrong  I'll give you an example of when I set a financial goal that wasn't a STAR goal and how it ultimately failed.  After I graduated from college and went to graduate school, I really started thinking about retirement. I knew that my IRA would be an important part of my retirement, and I knew that starting retirement savings early would pay massive dividends later on. So, I set the goal of putting aside the maximum allowed amount each year (then $5,000) into my IRA. That was my whole goal. My goal was specific - it was well-defined and gave a particular dollar amount. However, it was not timed, achievable, or realistic. It wasn't timed because I didn't think about how often I would put money aside or how much. It wasn't achievable because I was only making $20,000 per year pre-tax. If I put $5,000 from my paychecks aside, I would have only had $10,000-$11,000 a year for housing, food, clothing, utilities, etc. Housing and utilities alone were about $8,000 a year. (This was lower-middle class Indiana around 2008.) It wasn't realistic because I did not have a particular way to save money that I could actually stick to.  You might think, well, if he couldn't save $5,000 a year, he probably saved as much as he could. Nope.  To reach my goal, I would have needed to set aside $193 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks, which I simply couldn't do. My brain didn't go to, >well, just save what you can. My brain went to, I can't meet this goal with this paycheck. So, I'll skip it and do it with the next one. Except I didn't. I didn't ever. I occasionally saved money in my IRA - $100 here, $150 there. By the end of my five years in graduate school, I don't think I saved more than $4,000. That's way less than the $25,000 I wanted to save. In hindsight, failing to meet my goals stressed me out. It was easier for me to basically mentally abandon that goal.  What went wrong? My goal was simply impossible with my financial situation at the time. It wasn't a STAR goal. I set my sights too high. My goal should have been, I will save for retirement by depositing $100 from each of my paychecks for the next five years. That I could have managed. It wasn't my first choice of a goal, but it would have been a STAR goal. I could have gotten into a routine of saving that $100 from each check. That would have been $12,000-$13,000 saved by the time I graduated. It doesn't sound like much of a difference from $4,000 in the grand scheme of retiring, but believe me that it does make a huge difference. (We'll explore why in later units.)  What should you take from this? Yes, setting financial goals takes work. Yes, sticking to your goal paths takes even more work. But setting unreachable goals and failing to make any progress can be a nasty cycle. A good goal can break you out of those cycles.   "

  "title": "FAQ",
  "body": " FAQ    What if I don’t agree with the money personality quiz?  The money personality quiz is by no means an official psychological test. It is simply a tool to help you start thinking about how you tend to think about money. The important thing is for you to be honest with yourself about your feelings with regards to finances. You wouldn’t believe the level of mental gymnastics some people go through to rationalize unhealthy financial decisions. Financial decisions are not intrinsically “good” or “bad.” We want to understand why we behave the way we do.    Getting rich quick really isn’t part of financial literacy?  At its most fundamental, financial literacy is about understanding financial decisions with your current and predicable financial situation. It isn’t really about sudden expansions in your income stream. Here is the thing about avenues in which some people have obtained vast wealth quickly: For every person who has achieved wealth in a particular way, there are thousands who have tried and failed, often due to luck. Perhaps someone gambled heavily on a volatile stock and won. There are tens of thousands who have tried a similar gamble and lost. For every Internet personality who has gone viral, there are tens of thousands with equal or greater talents who have not gone viral. This is all related to something called “survivorship bias.”    What if I really want to achieve a goal that isn’t at all possible with my current finances?  Honestly, I would not concentrate on that goal for the time being. Some people may argue that an unattainable, lofty goal is good motivation, but I would argue that concentrating on something out of reach will create feelings of disappointment, despair, and frustration. Instead, I would set a goal of expanding your income with the same STAR attributes. Expanding your income may take quite a while, but there are routes to doing so. Once you’re in a situation in which your lofty goal is achievable and realistic, then put your energy (and money) into it.    I just want to learn about finances. What if I don’t care about the psychology stuff?  Life is complicated and difficult. Actions have consequences. I can tell you all the consequences of financial decisions, but that alone won’t turn you into a financial guru. Let’s take smoking as an example. You’ve been told from many different resources that smoking is an action with only negative consequences. Why do some people never smoke once? Why do some people choose to try smoking? Why do some people get addicted? Those questions have different answers for each person. It is the underlying psychology of each person that influence decisions. Given the exact same information, no two people will have the exact same reaction or decision. People can make some really unhealthy financial decisions with life-altering impacts. I am hoping that with some self reflection, you will understand your own urges and impulses and make decisions that are well-informed.    "

Source: https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/ photos\/saving    Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money. Our society makes it really easy for you to buy products or services with little to no thought. One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.   And it's really easy to overspend. Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure? Credit card. Need a flashier car? Payment plan. Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays? Cash advance. (These are not advice for these scenarios. Please don't do them. They're just examples of how easy it is the spend money you don't have.) A budget can be a tool that can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility. A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being. It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.  A budget will help track where your money goes. Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening. Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think. A budget will help you set and achieve STAR goals. By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them. A budget can help payoff your debts or help prevent falling into debt. Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.  Now, I'll tell you the truth. I do not currently set a budget for myself. I used to, but after getting an intuitive sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses. This is not because I'm wealthy. I'm the lowest paid associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system. This is because I set a strict budget for myself that I followed until it became habit. When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean. For most, it doesn't happen overnight. It takes time.  "

  "title": "Budgeting Rules",
  "body": " Budgeting Rules  In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules. There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks. Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.   The 50-30-20 Rule   Here is the rule. Your after-tax income ( take-home pay ) should be allocated so that 50% is spent on needs, 30% is spent on wants, and 20% is saved. That's it. Let's break down these three categories.   Source: https:\/\/www.infinitysolutions.com\/ blog\/do-you-have-trouble-budgeting-try-the-50-30-20-rule\/      Needs - A need is a necessity that you cannot do without. Housing, utilities, food, supplies, insurance, clothing, and transportation are examples of things considered necessities. Other things can definitely be considered needs, based on your individual situation.   Wants - A want is something that you would like to have but isn't strictly necessary for your survival. Eating out, entertainment, coffee, luxury items, and cosmetics are examples of things considered wants.   Savings - A savings item is simply an account in which you put money you do not spend that can be used for the future. Retirement accounts, savings accounts, and swear jars are all examples of things considered to be savings items.   Sounds simple, right? Here is one of the biggest barriers to the 50-30-20 rule. Most people are reluctant to label some desirable items as a want. Thinking to yourself, I couldn't live without coffee, doesn't make it a need. If you live where there is robust public transportation, owning a car may not be considered a need. Pet supplies are tricky. Is owning a pet a necessity? Most people with pets are hesitant to say no. What about Internet access? It may be a necessity, but is the highest speed possible a necessity?   Source: https:\/\/www.afspa.org\/blog\/ the-importance-of-self-care\/     Here is an important truth. If the thought of not having something makes you uncomfortable, that doesn't make the thing automatically a necessity.   Here some examples of things I've heard from people in my life very recently (at the time I wrote this section):       I just need Taco Bell for my mental health. It's my comfort food.      I couldn't survive without Door Dash.      We can't live anywhere that won't allow the sweets. ( Sweets are her cats. For context, they've been without housing for a year, and this was in response to an opportunity to get into an affordable place.)      Source: https:\/\/scc.sg\/e\/when-self-care-becomes-toxic\/       Activity: Classifying Spending  Let's practice categorizing things as needs, wants, or savings. For each item\/scenario, classify each as a need, a want, or savings. Pick only one. For each, explain your answer in one sentence.     401-k contributions automatically taken from your paycheck.    Going out to dinner after a really stressful week at work.    Car insurance.    Giving an allowance to your child.    Lottery tickets.    Buying stocks.    A Netflix subscription.    Paying for the repair of your refrigerator.    Cleaning supplies.    A limited-edition collector’s item.    The latest Taylor Swift album.    Child-support payments.       Debrief  Were some of these tricky? I hope so. In fact, you may have come up with different answers as others. Some may even depend on the context you imagine.    Allocating Money under the 50-30-20 Rule  Once you can categorize spending, you can get into the actual meat of the 50-30-20 plan. It can be tedious, and it requires you to have a very detailed and realistic record of your spending. Here is the rough steps in creating your budget.     First, determine how much money you make in a month. (You can also do it by week or by paycheck. However, since bills are usually paid monthly, it is best to budget monthly.) Your paycheck will likely be the biggest source of income, but there may be other sources. Any money that you take in counts. Make sure to only count what you actually get (the “net” amount). For example, if you work a job for 40 hours a week at $21 per hour, your weekly pay is . However, that is not what you actually get because of taxes. To simplify things, if you have an annual salary, take that amount and divide by 12 and then multiply by 0.7 to get your monthly net pay. If you are paid bi-weekly, multiply your paychecks by 2 to get your monthly amount. For weekly paychecks, multiply by 4. If your paychecks vary from check to check, do your best to come up with a monthly average.    Determine how much you can allocate to each category. For needs, we want 50% of your income. So, take your monthly income and multiply by 0.5. For wants, take your income and multiply by 0.3. For savings, take your income and multiply by 0.2. For example, suppose your monthly take-home income is $3,400. Then you can have devoted to needs, devoted to wants, and put into savings.    Make a list of everything you spend money on in a month. You can group things into categories. For example, don’t list out items from the grocery store. Just have one “groceries” item. This is probably the hardest step. Everything counts. Do you buy a mocha only once or twice a week? That’s $20-$40 from your monthly income that you can’t ignore. Be honest with yourself. It may be necessary to look at your credit card bill or debit card statement to really see where and when you spend money.    Categorize your items as needs, wants, or savings.    Add up how much you spend in each category and compare to what amounts you’re allowed. If you over-spend in a category, you may need to change how your finances work, which we’ll go over shortly. Also note that putting too much into savings is not really grounds for alarm. Only if you feel like you’re not enjoying how you’re spending money should you worry about saving too much.     At the end of this section, I've created a budget spreadsheet you are free to use.    The 80-20 Budget Plan  Sometimes, the 50-30-20 plan doesn't work. This is becoming more true for the millennial, Z, and alpha generations as housing costs are increasing more than wages. It is very common to find yourself in a position where you simply can't allocate only 50% of your paycheck to needs. One solution to that is to combine needs and wants into one category in which you allocate 80% of your take-home pay to needs and wants and 20% to savings.  Notice something. This version of the 50-30-20 plan essentially lowers the amount for wants in exchange for needs. It still requires you to save 20%. Generally, you should always prioritize saving over wants. It is vastly more important that you save for unexpected future expenses and retirement rather than spend on things you don't need.  The main benefit of the 80-20 budget is increased flexibility over the 50-30-20.  The increased flexibility of the 80-20 plan does come at a cost. Flexibility allows greater freedom. Greater freedom allows more opportunity to stray from the budget. Simply put, people want wants and do not want to save. It is really easy for the 80-20 plan to become the 100-0 plan. (The 100-0 plan is not a real plan. Please don’t do it.) If you find yourself in a situation where 70% of your paychecks go to necessities like housing, student loans, food, etc., it can be difficult to spend only 10% on stuff you want. Feeling overworked or overstressed can make wants feel like needs.  Under the 80-20 budget plan, you should still classify spending as needs, wants, and savings. It is important for your brain to see that certain spending behaviors are non-essential.    The Envelope System (A.K.A. Cash Stuffing    Source: https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/ about-us\/blog\/budgeting-how-to-create-a-budget-and-stick-with-it\/    One of the most classic budgeting methods is the envelope system. On social media, this is now often called “cash stuffing.” Traditionally, the envelope system requires you to take your entire paycheck in physical cash and allocate that cash into different envelopes for different spending activities. You could have a “rent” envelope, a “student loan” envelope, a “groceries” envelope, a “Dunkin'” envelope, a “savings” envelope, etc.   Once you distribute your cash, you do your best not to take money from an envelope for any reason other than its intended purpose. For example, don’t take money out of your “groceries” envelope because you want to go out to eat.  This budgeting method is great for people who tend to over-spend on non-necessities. If you find yourself spending money on things you know you shouldn’t, you can try the envelope method. Physically keeping money in labeled envelope can help you see and adhere to your money’s intended purpose. Further, the process of allocating money physically helps you see exactly where your money is going. If you find yourself transferring money from one envelope to another, you are physically seeing that you’re not sticking to your budget.  One big negative drawback of this system is that it requires you to have your money in cash. However, most bills are paid electronically these days. It also requires you to physically go to a bank or ATM to get cash. Further, your paychecks are usually more frequent than billing cycles. So, you have to learn to put parts of needed bill amounts in an envelope with each paycheck. Also, keeping physical cash around your place can be unsafe.  There are some apps available that can help set up a digital “envelope system.” We’ll discuss budgeting apps later in this unit’s material.    The Zero-Based Budget   The zero-based budget is a modern update on the envelope system. Under this system, when you get a paycheck, you meticulously give a purpose to every single dollar. So, you do not have just a “savings” category. You would, for example, say “$50 goes into my rainy-day fund. $50 goes into my retire savings. $20 goes into my fund for a vacation.” Beyond paying for your necessities, there are no requirements on how much goes where.   Source: https:\/\/www.bill.com\/ learning\/zero-based-budgeting     The benefit of the zero-based budget is for you to meticulously track your spending. No dollar goes unaccounted. Many people find it helpful in recognizing over-spending habits and starting to save more. Many businesses have adopted this method on a larger scale to help identify wasteful spending.  The zero-based budget requires a lot of work and dedication. Have you ever tried tracking calories for even just a week? It's hard and tedious. It's the same thing here. Every dollar you spend needs to be recorded and tracked. Many people are unable to keep up with the recording, which makes this budget useless. Also, some users of this budget method do not increase their savings amounts and instead simply spend their entire paychecks. Ultimately, it is not really a beginner-friendly approach to budgeting unless you have the discipline to stick to it.   "

  "title": "Balancing Your Budget",
  "body": " Balancing Your Budget  Budgeting is a skill that takes time and practice. It is also a matter of psychology. You have to work within the confines of your paychecks and your money personality to create and and adhere to a budget. In this section, we'll look at some ideas in helping you set and maintain a healthy budget.   What to Do When Your Budget Isn't Balanced  Generally, when you are unable to make the 50-30-20 plan, or similar plan, work, it is because your spending habits overpower how much income you have. There are a few things you can do to help get your budget in line.  - First, making more money may be an option. Ask your boss for a raise. Look around for a better-paying comparable job. Take on a small side-gig. You don't necessarily have to throw your arms up and accept not making enough. I know this is easier said than done, but it is a real possibility.   -Suppose you are over-spending in wants. The easiest thing to do is cut back on some of these items that are not essential. Yes, it is uncomfortable saying goodbye to things you get enjoyment from, but it may be necessary. Or perhaps simply altering the want can reduce expenses. For example, going to Chipotle physically rather than ordering Door Dash will lower that expense. Part of the reason for categorizing things as wants is for you to physically see those things as non-necessities. It can help you make the right, tough decisions.   Source: https:\/\/www.supermoney.com\/12-easy-ways-to-stop-overspending-now     -Suppose you are over-spending in needs but not in other areas. This is fairly common with the current cost of housing. This scenario is tougher, and it is one reason why the 50-30-20 isn’t right for some people. It may require you to make some big changes in your life. Getting a roommate if rent is too high, carpooling to work to save on gas, re-housing a pet to a good home if pet supplies are burdensome, shopping around for better insurance rates, changing Internet providers are all examples changes that could help your needs spending down.  -Suppose you are saving more than 20% of your income. This may not be a bad thing if you are meeting your needs and feel satisfied with how many wants you’re able to fulfill. However, if you are saving so much that you are not paying for your needs or are feeling unsatisfied with what wants you’re able to have, it may be ok to allow yourself to spend more. Of course, depending on your savings goals, saving more than 20% may be a necessary part of the plan.  -If you find yourself over-spending on wants and under-saving, I highly recommend setting up automatic deposits or transfers into a long-term savings account that is separate from your spending\/checking account. This effectively forces you to put part of your paycheck aside for savings and giving you a smaller amount to spend each month.    What Not to Do When Your Budget Isn't Balanced   When rent or car insurance comes due, pressure can really mount up and burden you. There are healthy ways to get your budget under control, but there are some things you should avoid.   Source: https:\/\/www.barringtonbhw.com\/ problem-gambling-month\/     -Pay-day loans. Pay-day loans are short-term, high-interest loans. For example, if you’re paychecks are usually $1,000 bi-weekly, the pay-day loan place may give you $900 now in exchange for your $1,000 coming in two weeks. Under that agreement, you are agreeing to a loan with 1448% interest. For context, a mortgage loan is currently around 6%. Here is the real evil about these places. People go to these places because they’re broke and need cash to pay bills immediately. Sacrificing a solid chunk of your paycheck often isn’t really manageable. For example, if you are unable to pay bills with your $1,000 biweekly checks, then how could you do it by giving a pay-day loan place $100 on top of your bills? Many people are unable to payback their short-term loan with their paychecks. When this happens, they owe a pay-day loan company money under an extraordinarily-high interest rate that grows exponentially. What you owe becomes completely unmanageable within just a few weeks. Never take out a short-term cash loan (either from a pay-day loan place or a cash-advance on your credit card). Grab a casual job stocking shelves at a local grocer. Call your landlord and explain the situation to try to negotiate a short extension on rent. Sell something you’re not using much. Please don’t resort to a short-term cash loan.  -Gambling and lottery. Just don’t gamble. We’ll discuss the psychology of gambling in a later unit, but for now, just acknowledge that gambling is not a valid way to get cash you need to pay bills. You’ll just make your situation worse.    Some Potentially-Risky Ways to Get Relief from Bills  When you need to pay for needs immediately, there are some methods or some people turn to. However, these methods can be tricky to navigate and may not be worth it.   -Asking for a personal loan. Here is a life lesson many people don't learn until it's too late. Never loan money to a friend or family unless you are fully prepared never to see that money again. Money complicates relationships. On the borrower side, asking for financial help can put stress on a friendship or relationship. A personal loan can be a potential source of immediate relief with bills, but please reflect deeply on the situation first. Think of the person you're asking; you put them in a really tough position of wanting to help provide support but at the expense of the stress of giving their own money and jeopardizing their relationship with you. It may be better if you look for ways to earn income rather than ask someone for a loan.   Source: https:\/\/www.moneysmartguides.com\/web-stories\/how-to-say-no-family-financial-requests     -Debt consolidation. You have likely seen commercials for debt consolidation. These are for companies that essentially take on your various debts by paying them for you in exchange for regular payments from you. Debt consolidation can be an option if you have a lot of high-interest debt . In that case, you are effectively re-financing your debt at a lower rate. The issue is that many of the companies that advertise this service have predatory tactics. One common one is that in exchange for this service, they tack on a large “fee” to what you owe (on top of the interest they get from you). Another tactic is putting you on a variable interest rate in which you start with a low rate to them, but that rate grows over time. Another tactic is to advertise low monthly payments, but extend the length of those payments drastically. If you find yourself in a great deal of high-interest debt, research ways to lower the interest rate on what you owe. If you cannot refinance a loan, debt consolidation may be a resource. However, please research options carefully. In general, try to go through a local, trustworthy bank rather than a financial institution.    Inconsistent Paychecks  Many people do not have a set salary with near-identical paychecks each week. For example, people who operate their own small business may see different amounts of income month-to-month. Not being able to predict how much you’ll make in future months makes budgeting more challenging. Here are a few ideas to consider when building a budget.  -If possible, try to determine an “average” or “typical” month in terms of income. If you can be fairly sure that, on average, you have a certain amount of money coming in, it is very possible to make a budget. The issue is that in months of higher-than-average income, you have to set the extra money aside as “income” in lower-than-average months. For example, suppose that you determined that, on average, you have $3,000 in income. Let’s say one month you earned $4,000. Then your income for the month is $3,000 that can be used for your needs, wants, and savings. The extra $1,000 is not income for that month. It is set aside, and when you have a month of lower income, say $2,200, you have that saved $1,000 to make up the shortfall. It takes more discipline, but it is definitely manageable.  -Do not consider “bonuses” as part of your regular income. Some jobs pay bonuses at the end of the year. If you start to think of an expected bonus as part of your income, you may find yourself in a tricky situation when a bonus comes in lower than expected (or not at all).  -Even with the best of planning, sometimes someone with inconsistent paychecks find themselves in a long drought of work or productivity. In a circumstance like this, you may want to consider a career change or be willing to do contract work like Uber or Task Rabbit.    Rainy-Day Funds  We’ve mentioned “rainy-day” funds, but we haven’t really talked about them. A “rainy-day fund” is an easily-accessible pot of money that is used for unexpected expenses. Needing to pay for an unexpected large medical insurance deductible, a veterinary bill, or a car-repair bill are all examples of infrequent, unexpected costs that you don’t include explicitly in a monthly budget. A rainy-day fund is a fund to pay for these expenses. Some people refer to their rainy-day fund as a “cushion.”  If you do not have funds available to pay for unexpected bills, you may end up going into debt, which will increase how much you spend each month in bills. It is not recommended to withdraw funds from long-term accounts like retirement accounts for unexpected bills. It is best if you have a separate account for a rainy-day fund.  Generally, it is recommended that a rainy-day fund has about six months worth of necessary expenses. For example, if you determine that a normal month requires around $2,000 in “needs” like rent and food, then you should aim to have rainy-day fund of $12,000. The reasons for this high amount are many. If you lose your job, it can take months to find another one. Veterinary and car bills can range in the thousands of dollars. A lot of life can happen, and it can happen all at once.  It is usually recommended that you start building a rainy-day fund before other kinds of savings. Certainly focus on a rainy-day fund over saving for a vacation. Of course, it is appropriate to put aside money in both a rainy-day fund and a long-term investment fund simultaneously.  One important note is that many people think of a “rainy-day” fund and an “emergency” fund as separate. That is fine. They have the same function - they are both to pay for unexpected bills or costs. The main difference is the amounts in each. I just think of these as one “rainy-day” fund.    Negotiaing Expenses  I was going to include this as a way to help balance your budget, but it is so important that it gets its own little subsection.  Did you know you can negotiate some of your monthly bills?  First, a little background on business in the US. If you ask your parents or grandparents about how much TV cable subscriptions used to be, you’ll find that the costs of these services has grown far more than any other cost in the US, including housing. Most of this rise in cost is nothing but pure profit to the companies. Have you ever wondered why Time-Warner and Comcost never provide service in the same area. (If you live in an area service by Comcast, have you even heard of Time-Warner? Or vice-versa?) That is because they have a back-door agreement not to compete with each other. By not competing, they do not need to compete for your business by offering competitive prices. If you’re thinking that this is a monopoly and shouldn’t be allowed, you’re half right. It’s called an “oligopoly,” which is really just a monopoly that is perfectly legal in the US and forms the foundation of many industries like cable, phone providers, airlines, baby formula, and music. It’s all rather depressing. However, it means that for services like these, companies can offer you their services for much cheaper and still make a hefty profit.  Here is a rule of life. If a company is willing to offer you a product of service at a certain price for a month or year, they can do so again for the next month\/year. (Free-trials are not included.) If your cable company offers you an “introductory rate” for a year, they will be willing to offer it again the next year. Yes, there are exceptions, but it is a good rule to live by. A company would rather make some profit off of you rather than no profit.  Here is how you do it. Simply call or text with a customer service representative and ask to renegotiate your service plan or you will cancel your service. Here are some basic tips.  -If they refuse, continue with canceling. Even if it is something you know you really need\/want to keep, continue with canceling. Often, if they see you’re not bluffing, you’ll get an offer for a lower rate. At worst, you actually do cancel your service. If so, learn to live without the service or simply restart the service. All that would be wasted is a few minutes of your life. (Note that there are some old “grandfathered” plans people have. You may hear some people talk about “YouTube Red” that they’ll never get rid of. I have an old grandfathered plan with T-Mobile that is much better than any other plan I could possibly get these days. Don’t give those up unless you actually want to get rid of the service.)  -Never take the first offer unless its better than what you have. I just recently negotiated my XM radio subscription. It started at $21.99 per month. First offer was $17.99. Second was $7.09. Last was $4.09, which was my “introductory offer.” They won’t take an offer away once they’ve offered it to you.  -Sometimes you can ask to be “treated as a new customer.” That is, ask to have access to an introductory rate offered to non-existing customers.  -You can sometimes negotiate a better interest rate on your credit cards, which lowers how much you need to pay each month on them (if you carry a balance). Keep in mind that this sometimes requires a hard credit check, which will lower your credit score. We’ll talk about credit in a later unit.  -Rent can be negotiated, to an extent. It never hurts to ask your landlord to negotiate rent. However, in a market such as this one, you’re unlikely to be successful as there will be someone willing and able to pay what you’re paying. On the other hand, you do not always need to put up with large rent hikes. If you find yourself in a situation in which your rent is suddenly increased massively, you may be able to fight it in housing court. (Not civil court.)  Keep in mind that not all bills can be negotiated. Cable, phone, entertainment subscriptions, magazines, are examples of services that can be negotiated. Utilities, groceries, and other consumable products are generally not negotiable.    Activity: Helping Balance a Budget  In preparation for this course, I’ve been scouring Reddit for questions and comments regarding budgeting. Below are some common questions or comments from people. For each, give some suggestions that could be of use to the person.     “How is it even possible to save money when half of it goes just to my rent?”    “Every time I try to budget, I can never get the numbers to add up. I always end up giving up on it.”    “How do you even not spend your whole paycheck? I mean, if I have the cash for Uber Eats, then how am I going to be cooking after work every night?”    “How am I supposed to budget when I have to predict how much I’m going to spend? How am I supposed to know whether I’m going to spend $200 or $1,000 on groceries next month?”    “So, some months I get lots of overtime at my job, but it’s really unpredictable. How can I make a solid budget taking into account my sporadic overtime?”      "

  "body": " FAQ    Does a budget like the 50-30-20 budget apply to students?  A budget plan is simply a guide for how to manage money and are not concrete things. Numbers can be changed to adapt to certain situations. Some students choose to work just enough to pay for college expenses, and that’s ok. A budget is meant to help you gain and maintain financial stability. If you’re in a situation where you still have most of your expenses paid for by your parents, then the numbers involved may look different. Perhaps you could save more than 20% of money you earn?    Do I need to spend 50% of my money on needs?  No. First, a budget is simply a tool for helping you achieve and maintain financial health. It is not a law of the world. Think of the 50-30-20 rule more as a guideline in which you should aim so that no more than 50% of your income goes to needs and no more than 30% goes to wants.    How do taxes play a role in budgeting.  For the majority of people in the US, taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. So, you do not need to budget for taxes. You base your budget on your after-tax or take-home amount. So, after your taxes have been removed, you build your budget around what you get post-taxes.    Should I learn how to avoid taxes?  No. That’s called “tax evasion.” Taxes pay for education, roads, law enforcement, parks, sanitation, etc. Taxes are necessary for maintaining the benefits of living in a country like the US. There are legitimate ways to reduce what you pay in taxes, which we’ll cover in a later unit.    How does insurance play a role in budgeting?  For most types of insurance, you factor insurance into your budget as a need. The tricky one is medical insurance. If you get medical insurance through your employer, you likely pay a part of the premium (usually 25%) out of your paycheck automatically. You have a choice with this. If possible, you could think of that automatic insurance premium payment like a tax and use your post-tax, post-insurance pay for budgeting. However, you can also include the premium payment as a need. In that case, you would need to add what you pay in insurance premium to your after-tax pay amount and then build your budget, including medical insurance as a need. For example, if your after-tax pay is $2,000 each month and insurance is $200 each month (making your paychecks total $1,800), you could take $1,800 as your money used for budgeting, basing percentages off $1,800 and not including medical insurance in the budget. You could also take $2,000 as your pay (even though you only get paychecks totaling $1,800) and base percentages off that, but you need to make sure that the $200 is listed as a need in your budget.    How do I stop my bank account from going negative?  If you can, pretend that $0 isn’t a balance of $0. Make a mental note that some amount, say $100, is effectively $0. That is, if you see your account approaching $100, you tell yourself you are out of money and can no longer spend until you have more. The more you earn\/spend as life goes on, you’ll want that minimum number to be higher. Note that this minimum amount is different than a rainy-day or emergency fund.    How do I get rich by making a budget?  A budget isn’t about accumulating wealth. It is about getting and maintaining financial health. The savings component of a budget will help with accumulating long-term savings or retirement, but it is not a way to get rich quick. However, sticking to a budget can help you get rich slow and steady, or at least help lift yourself out of poverty.    There are some things I label as wants, but I can’t go a day without them. What should I do?  If you find yourself in a situation where you need to cut back on wants but your brain is really driving you to keep buying a certain thing, you may be looking at an addiction. It may be worth talking with someone at the Counseling Center about getting some tips to cut back.    "

He wants to enjoy more from life while also saving for retirement and education. So, he would like to spend no more than 50% on necessities. He is married with two children. He works full-time, and his husband works part-time as the primary care-giver. Max has already asked his boss for a raise, and he cannot change careers right now. Make recommendations for how Max can reach his budget goals.         We targeted two learning objectives in this unit: life-long learning, metacognitive reflection, accessing welling tools, and social-emotional skills. For each of the learning goals, write a few sentences as to how this unit’s material has helped you progress toward meeting those learning objectives. The four learning goal descriptions are as follows:     Lifelong Learning: Students practice skills and attitudes central to lifelong learning; including a growth mindset that encompasses self-reflection, flexibility, intellectual curiosity, and considers broad perspectives and diversity of thought.    Metacognitive Reflection and Application: Students reflect on their own wellbeing in the context of the course topic and develop metacognitive reflection abilities that work to promote transfer of wellness behaviors and skills.

  "title": "Budgeting Tools",
  "body": " Budgeting Tools  Budgeting doesn't have to be with just a notepad and a pencil. There are some great resources to help create a clean and understandable budget.   Paper Tools  For many people, the act of physically writing something can make it more concrete and real. If you are one of those people, doing your budget on paper may be the way to go. At the end of this section, I’ve included a possible monthly budget worksheet that I’ve created. It is one of many possible templates out there. Feel free to print it out if you’d like.  A paper budget is fairly easy in concept. In the respective areas, write down your usual expenses in a month. Don’t include infrequent things like getting a tire repaired. Of course, you can include a “miscellaneous” in either needs or wants (or both). Ultimately, you need to make sure that your expenses, including savings, are no more than your total income for a month. If they are higher, you immediately know that you need to examine your expenses and make some changes. Once you’ve made sure you can afford your proposed month, you should make sure your budget falls in line with your savings goals. Whether it be the 20% or something different, ask yourself if you’re putting enough away for what you want to achieve. If not, you may need to make some changes to get your savings component higher.  The downside to a paper budget is that they are not very secure and it is harder to keep a record of them.    Spreadsheets  As more people brought personal computers into their homes, budgeting on spreadsheets became very common. Any spreadsheet program works. There are even some programs available targeted specifically for budgeting, usually at a cost. I’m using “program” here rather than “app” to include hard-drive bound applications and locally-saved files. I understand that the term “program” is falling out of use. I am partial to Excel as my program of choice, which you can download for free as a Westfield State student.  The nice thing about spreadsheets is that you can “program” them to automatically add-up totals, find percentages, or find differences (among other things). You can also simply type in numbers and calculate what you need to by hand. Ultimately, the process is the same as if you were working on paper. One big benefit is that you can download a spreadsheet file of all your purchases in a month from your credit card account or withdrawals from your bank account and paste them right into your spreadsheet. If you browse Reddit for a while, you’ll find most long-term budget users use spreadsheets over a fancy app.  The downside of spreadsheet programs is the learning curve to some of them. You may need a working knowledge of your program of choice before you can really use them.  I have uploaded two files on Plato for you to look at. One is a blank budget template that you free to use. The other is a simple example what a budget could look like.    Apps  The popularity of budgeting apps has been skyrocketing over the past number of years. They can be as simple or complex as you like. Some even connect to your bank, credit cards, and utilities accounts to automatically update values and make recommendations. One benefit to an app is that for people who do not have the discipline to stick with a spreadsheet month-to-month, an app can make the process more inviting, colorful, and efficient.  Before progressing, a word of caution. As with everything in our connected world, access to services usually comes with security issues. Different apps collect different amounts of your private information. Before downloading any app or connecting something to one of your accounts, do some research into what information is collected and how it is stored and used. Only use a service in which you are comfortable with its information policies. Below, I give a couple of examples of popular budgeting apps. I don’t have a recommendation, and I do not make any claims to their information security policies. This is all informational stuff.  Here is another word of warning, and a life lesson. You’ll notice that most popular budgeting apps are not free, or they have very limited free versions that are barely useful. You’ll also see a price tag well beyond what they’re worth. (As in $10-$20 a month.) Here is why. The target audience of these apps are people who either are new to personal finance or have a history of poor budgeting habits. These companies are hoping to capitalize on this inexperience or lack of confidence. You have to ask yourself if the polish and extra features of a paid app are worth $100-$200 a year for you.  -Goodbudget. Goodbudget uses the envelope method of budgeting. There is a “free” version that limits you to 10 “envelopes” (plus 10 miscellaneous envelopes) and does not connect to your bank. The paid version is either $10 a month or $80 a year. Essentially, you tell Goodbudget how much your paychecks are. You then set up virtual “envelopes” to allocate money. You can also tell it how much debt you have and how you are paying it off (like car loans or credit cards). Goodbudget is more about planning for your next month than it is reflecting on your past expenses. So, if you are looking for insight on why last month’s budget went awry, Goodbudget may not be the best option. The app also has no way of telling when you overspend from an envelope. If you budgeted $250 for groceries but spent $300, you’ll need to update that manually. If you need some help planning and have the discipline to manually enter and keep track of your expenses, Goodbudget may work.  -YNAB. (Used to be “You Need A Budget.” Not it’s “Why-Nab.”) YNAB might be the most polished, and expensive, app available. It is $15 per month or $110 per year. Much of your money goes toward the polish, but that is important for some people. YNAB connects to most bank accounts. If you use your debit card or direct pay for most expenses, YNAB can automatically determine what category each expense falls into. YNAB uses the zero-balance budget method, which asks you to spend or save every dollar of income. It also comes with a bunch of pretty graphs, if that sort of thing excites you. College students can get a one-year “free” trial of YNAB. (“Free” in that you still need to give it billing information that will automatically kick in unless you jump through the hoops to delete your account.) The big claim to YNAB are the educational resources. It gives suggestions on how to allocate your money. (A fancier version of the 50-30-20 rule.)  -PocketGuard. First, PocketGuard costs $75 per year. PocketGuard is a bit different. It is designed more around lowering expenses first and then budgeting afterward. It claims to help detect unnecessary subscriptions and will “negotiate” with certain companies for better rates. (E.g., a better monthly rate for Internet.) It connects to most of your financial accounts including your bank, credit cards, loan providers, etc. The budgeting aspect is fairly basic. After your automatic monthly expenses are deducted, you build your budget manually around it. It can auto-categorize expenses from your bank or credit card statements. I do NOT recommend “trying” PocketGuard to see if it lowers your bills. You will be charged $75 and locked into a subscription whether or not it actually does what it claims.   Again, please be careful with these apps . Whether it be becoming locked into a paid subscription or giving access to your financial information, these apps exist for the companies’ benefit. Your benefit is secondary to them. Do research and make informed decisions.   "

  "body": " Saving Money on Groceries   Cooking vs. Eating Out r  Here’s an interesting question. Which is cheaper: eating out of cooking yourself? The answer actually depends. Let’s suppose you would like one hamburger and french fries. Suppose the burger will be 1\/3 lb with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. At a restaurant in the Westfield area, a burger and fries will cost about $12 - $17 plus tax and tip. So, about $15-$22. If you go to fast food (e.g. Five Guys or Burger King), you’re looking at a similar price minus tip. So, about $13-$16. If you want to make it yourself, you need ingredients. This is where things get really variable.   Source: https:\/\/brokeassstuart.com\/ 2022\/02\/16\/why-are-restaurants-so-expensive-now\/     Suppose you have no ingredients needed. Ground beef is about $6\/lb, sold in quantities of about 1.25 lbs. So, $7.50. A head of iceberg lettuce is about $2.50. One tomato will be about $1. A bottle of mayonnaise is about $4. A package of hamburger buns is about $4. A bag of french fries is about $4. Canisters of salt and pepper to season the burger will be about $5. So, everything together will be about $28 to cook yourself a hamburger and fries.  However, let’s suppose you have a group of four people who will each get a hamburger and fries. Eating a restaurant will yield a bill of about $60-$80. Fast food will be $52-$64. However, the grocery price won’t change. It’s $28 because you’ll have enough with the ingredients to make four services. So, it works out to be $7 per person.  In general, it is cheaper to cook at home when there are multiple people eating. However, cooking for just yourself can be a bit precarious, price-wise. That $28 for a burger and fries looks pretty daunting. The thing is, that $28 was based on the assumption that you had no ingredients. Suppose instead that you previous bought beef and french fries and froze what you didn’t use and already had items that can be stored like mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. Then you just need buns, lettuce, and tomato, which would run you about $7.50, which is a good deal cheaper than eating out.  So, a general rule is that, over all, it is cheaper to cook yourself if you are prudent with saving ingredients.     Activity: Why Do You Eat Out?  For this activity, list the two biggest or most frequent reasons that you go somewhere to eat. (Restaurants, fast food, etc. The Dining Commons doesn’t count as eating out.) For each reason, come up with a way your could satisfy that reason while still cooking at home or in a dorm kitchen. If it is impossible to satisfy a reason to go out at home, say why.    Buying in Bulk  Here is a general rule of grocery shopping.  It is cheaper to larger quantities of food.          Here is a quick example with chicken breasts. These photos were taken at the same store on the same day. Notice that for a package of two chicken breasts, the price is $3.49 per pound. If you buy a package of four chicken breasts, the price is $2.79 per pound. Suppose one chicken breast is around 0.7lbs. If you need four breasts, buying two packages of two breasts would be , and buying the package of four breasts would be   Why is this quantity phenomenon the case? There are actually a variety of reasons at play. One component is that buy selling you larger quantities at once, the store is selling more of its product and will likely need to discard as much expired food. So, they pass some of that savings to you. Another component is the hope that you will waste excess food. For example, if you only need three chicken breasts but buy a package of four, they are hoping you will discard that fourth breast rather than freeze and save it for later. There are also a plethora of reasons regarding supply chains and deliver costs. No matter the reasons, also remember the general rule of savings when buying in larger quantities.  There is one issue with buying in bulk. Storage. If you thought to yourself in the chicken example, “but I only need one chicken breast for me,” you are thinking about the chicken you don’t have a plan for. That is a very common thought. To buy in bulk, you need a place to store excess food safely. For shelf-stable products like bottles of ketchup, which can last a long time in a refrigerator, it is easy to store such items. However, for highly-perishable items like chicken, it is less obvious.  The answer is a freezer. A freezer is key to saving money at the grocery store. In fact, I may even recommend looking into a second chest freeze in addition to the freezer in your refrigerator. If you freeze perishable items, such as meats, you can spend much less on groceries over time.  Now, if you had a feeling of disgust at eating chicken that had been put into your freezer, then I am sorry to have to break it to you that the chicken at your supermarket was probably previously frozen already. Unless a product is labeled as “fresh” or “never-frozen,” it was probably frozen. Generally, never-frozen items cost more than the ones that have been frozen. The point is, it is highly recommended to get over the negative reactions to products that have been frozen.  Of course, some things can’t really be frozen, such as lettuce (which is why you’ll never see bags of 10lbs of lettuce at the store). Such items can’t really be bought in bulk.    Comparing Prices   Similar to buying in bulk is the concept of comparing prices. Suppose you want to buy Pepsi. A 2-liter bottle is $2.50, but 20oz bottles are on sale for $1.00 each. Which is the better buy? If your math-phobia is starting to kick in, the good news is that most stores will tell you. Kind of.   Source: https:\/\/www.spfb.org\/ blog\/healthy-eating-on-a-budget\/     Most price tags at a large supermarket will have multiple numbers on it. Of course, there is the “retail price” - the price you will actually pay. However, there is often a second figure - the “unit price.” The unit price gives you how much you are spending on the product per unit, such as per pound, per ounce, per liter, etc. In fact, in Massachusetts, large retailers are required by law to tell you the per-unit price to help consumers make better decisions.  In the Pepsi example, the answer depends on what the per-unit prices are. If the unit is in fluid ounces, then the 2-liter bottle is about $0.04 per ounce. The 20oz bottles are $0.05 per ounce. So, the 2-liter bottle is consider the better buy.  You should immediately get into the habit of looking at per-unit prices alongside the retail prices. It can help you make clear the price difference among different brands or different quantities. If you are looking to save money, go with the items with lower unit prices. Of course, if you cannot safely store larger quantities, it may not be best to buy in large quantities, even if the per-unit price is better. You never want to waste food, if you can avoid it.    Cook Once, Eat a Lot  The number one reason why people go out to eat is to break up the stress and monotony that comes with work and maintaining a family and home day to day. One method for helping with this stress while also saving a great deal of money is to cook for more than one meal at a time. That is, prepare more servings of a meal and save them for later. Learning to use and appreciate leftovers is an excellent money-saving strategy.  For example, if you cook for a family of four, perhaps you could prepare a dinner to feed eight. Use four servings one night and save the other four servings for a night when you are really attempted to take everyone out to a restaurant. If you cook for yourself, you could perhaps prepare a dish meant to serve four and use the extra three servings as lunches to take to work or for dinners later in the week.  Many people are averse to microwaved food. The solution there is to reheat objects in an oven. Yes, it takes longer, but ovens can help maintain the original water distribution in reheated food.    Wholesale Clubs r  How does the thought of paying $30-$60 per year for the privilege of buying groceries sound? How does the thought of paying $30-$60 per year in order spend only 50%-90%of what you would at a grocery store sound? Until the COVID lockdown, most consumers focused on the first question. In resent years, many people’s minds have maneuvered to the second question. Being a member of a wholesale club can potentially be a way to save a lot of money.   Source: https:\/\/www.costco.com\/new-locations.html     Firstly, “wholesale” refers to the concept of buying a product as it comes from its manufacturer. When you’re in line in a grocery store, do you notice that the candy bars they sell are in a box. The grocery store buys that box “wholesale” from the candy distributer. A wholesale club is a company that purchases whole items and will then sell those items wholesale to consumers for prices at or near what the club pays. So, think of it as being able to buy that box of candy for near the same price the grocery store pays. In essence, a wholesale club is where you can engage in expert mode of buying in bulk.  A wholesale club gets much of its profits through membership fees. Those fees are used to pay employee salaries, invest for company growth, etc. When done right, it’s a surprisingly-stable business model. In our area, the biggest options are B.J.’s, Costco, and Sam’s Club. Although the most expensive, I recommend Costco for a variety of reasons. (How they treat employees, supply-chain robustness, ways to get your membership paid for, etc.)  Just before writing this chapter, I did some reconnaissance. I looked at some unit prices of some common items at the West Springfield Costco and the Stop and Shop next door. The Stop and Shop prices are for the cheapest per-unit price I could find.   Price Comparisons    Product  Costco  S S    Limes  $0.137\/oz  $0.21\/oz    Cheerios  $0.21\/oz  $0.36\/oz.    Milk Gallon  $3.29\/Gal  $4.29\/Gal    Cage-free Eggs  $3.45\/doz  $7.49\/doz*    Chicken breasts  $2.99\/lb  $2.79\/lb**    New York Steak  $13.99\/lb  $16.49\/lb    Similac Baby Formula  $1.40\/oz  $1.77\/oz     *This was at the start of the avian flu outbreak. Costco didn’t price gouge.  **Costco breasts are mostly trimmed. Stop and Shop breasts are untrimmed.  These products are not unique. Generally, items are cheaper at wholesale clubs. Sometimes a little cheaper, sometimes a lot. It doesn’t take long for the membership fee to become more than worth the investment.  There are some downsides to wholesale clubs. First and foremost is the quantity of items. Some items are require a great deal of storage, such as an 18-pack of large paper towel rolls. Shopping at wholesale clubs requires room in your fridge\/freezer, pantry, and closets. There is also the membership fee. Many people cannot part with the $30-$60 upfront. They are investments. There is also product rotation. Wholesale clubs make certain arrangements with suppliers. Many products have temporary availability. The last is crowds. People have come to appreciate the prices and supply chains wholesale clubs have. Many locations serve more customers per day than many prefer; they’re not the best places if you’re afraid of crowds.    Activity: It Costs Money to Save  Notice that in the four grocery-bill-savings options above, each one requires you to pay more money up front than if you bought on a meal-per-meal basis. This is true in most sectors of our economy. The more money you have available now, the cheaper things will be for you overall. Write a few sentences about how you feel about this fact and why.    Alternative-Brand Stores r  What’s your reaction if I suggest shopping at Aldi’s? For many people who grew up middle class, it’s one of almost disgust or judgement. It that is you, I would suggest trying to get over that.   Source: https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/ 2024\/03\/07\/business\/aldi-expansion\/index.html     Some stores sell food products from brands that are not sold in major supermarkets. The thing about Americans is that brand recognition is one of the cornerstones of our economy. Do you even know what I’m talking about when I name products like adhesive strips, salicylates, hoop-and-loop fasteners, or personal water crafts? (Band-Aid’s, Aspirin, Velcro, and Jet-Ski. All of them just brands.) We tend not to trust brands we’ve never heard of. (Affinity bias!) It goes a step further. Take produce, which usually isn’t branded. We’re less likely to shop for produce at a place that doesn’t carry the brands on other products that we recognize.  If you can get past your affinity bias, these stores can save you a lot of money. The chain in our region is Aldi’s. There are also independent markets all over the greater Springfield area. Some people might put Trader Joe’s in this category. If you’re having trouble getting over that bias, remember that most of the food that is sold in a place like Aldi’s come from the exact same factories and supplies as those sold in Big Y or Stop and Shop. It really is all down to brand recognition.    Shopping the Sales  There is one major point of common misunderstanding about anchoring bias. Because of how sales are advertised, they can trigger our anchoring bias. However, the simple acting of buying an item that is on sale may not necessarily be anchoring bias. If you seeing something marked down causes you to be interested in a product you weren’t interested in before, that is anchoring bias. If there is an item that you buy all the time that goes on sale and you take advantage of the lower price, that isn’t really anchoring bias. It’s a good way to save money.  As you do more and more of your own shopping, you’ll come to know what products you buy regularly. When one of those products goes on sale, it can be a good strategy to “stock up” on that item. For example, I use a lot of chocolate in my baking. I know I’ll use a hefty amount each week. When my usual chocolate bars go on sale, I buy a few week’s worth.  Many people call this strategy “couponing.” It is a good way to save money, but it can be dangerous. Shopping sales can trigger anchoring bias and influence you to buy something you weren’t planning on purchasing. In fact, our local Stop and Shops have tags that look like sales tags that say, “Great value! Stock up now.” Nothing is on sale. They’re trying to trigger your anchoring bias without actually offering any discount.    Activity: What Are You Going to Do to Save on Groceries?  Grocery prices are rising, and they’re only going to get worse. Imagine you are an over-worked and underpaid human as most of us are. How are you going to save money on food?

  "body": " Saving Money on Housing   Rent and Mortgages  Get a roommate.  It’s that simple. Roommates are excellent in keeping housing costs down.  If you are turning your nose up at the idea, it may be because your expectations for standards of living for recent high school or college graduates really is. I know with three of my four kids, they whole-heartedly believed that they would be able to afford the same kind of home that they were leaving after high school. The truth is that your first independent housing that you have in your 20’s will likely be much different than the housing your parents or guardians have in their 40’s or 50’s. Needing to share a place with a roommate for your first few years on your own is extremely common, if not the path for most people.  In terms of simple cost, would you rather pay $1,500 yourself for a one-bedroom apartment or split $1,800 with another person for a two-bedroom apartment? Splitting $1,800 would save you $600 per month, which is nothing to laugh at. $600 per month can be saved into a sizeable down payment on a housing in just a few years.    Utilities  If you talk to home-owners, they’ll tell you that the cost to heat their homes is getting really high. If you’ve never paid for utilities before, they’re an easy expense to overlook when you’re considering housing options. There are a few techniques I’ll share than can help with utility costs.    Source: https:\/\/www.redbubble.com\/ i\/poster\/Electric-Company-Monopoly-utilities-card-by-RstyBcktWkshp\/ 123204600.LVTDI    First, utilities can either be supplied by a company or a town. Almost always, utilities managed by a town are far cheaper than utilities supplied by a company. The reason is simple; companies supply utilities for a profit, town’s are non-profit entities. As an example, I lived in Palmer, MA previously. In my last year, it cost about $300\/mo to run air conditioners in the summer. In my current place in Holyoke, MA, it costs about $100, if that. Towns in our region that have utilities supplied by the town itself include Holyoke, Westfield, and Chicopee.   Massachusetts has a fairly robust fuel-assistance program. These kinds of programs essentially help you pay for utilities. These are especially useful in your first few years in a career where you will not be making as much as your more experienced seniors. These programs are available to lower-income households, meaning that you cannot make more than a certain amount, which depends on a number of factors. I highly recommend applying to see if you’re eligible. ( https:\/\/www.mass.gov\/how-to\/apply-for-home-heating-and-energy-assistance )  My father has a habit that I thought was the strangest thing growing up. He turns off the water in the shower mid-cleaning. It’s to save money on both water and heating. Now that I pay my own bills, I see the wisdom in that level of frugality. In general, learning to having utilities on only when you are using them can really help save you money. Turn lights off when not in the room. Turn the heat or A\/C down when you leave the house. Fill a sink with water for dishes rather than have a faucet run the whole time. Unplug non-essential things from wall sockets when not in use. You’d be surprised how much excess energy\/water we can use over time.

In fact, some companies will even offer introductory prices way below profitability to get you to sign up and hopefully forget them (or just now use them). Gyms, ancestory sites, and fan subscriptions are some of the biggest culprits today. Here is a general rule, if you haven’t used a service that you’ve been paying for in three months, why are you paying for it? Ditch it. You can always restart it if you feel the need.   Source: https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com \/business\/ 2024\/10\/23\/ftc-click-to-cancel-subscriptions-save\/       Pay Yourself First  This technique was mentioned in the budgeting chapter, but it really is a great way to get yourself to reduce spending. When you “pay yourself first,” you put your planned amount into savings before you use any money on wants. For example, if your goal is to save 20%of your take-home pay, when you get your paychecks, you put 20%in savings right away. I highly recommend setting up an automatic system where some amount of money is automatically put into savings accounts. This can be done at the paycheck stage in which you can set some percentage of your paychecks to go to a savings account. It can also be after a paycheck is deposited into your main account in which a set amount is automatically transferred to a different savings account. When you have money automatically pulled into an account that is harder to withdraw money from, you essentially force yourself to do more with less money, saving you from overspending on wants.    Pay Off High-interest Debt  If you find yourself with a decent amount of high-interest debt, such as credit cards or some student loans, you may want to focus some of your spending on paying off that debt, even if it means cutting way back on wants for a while. Many people pay hundreds or even thousands per month on just the interest on debt. If you can make the sacrifices needed to get out from under that debt, you’ll have a much more fulfilling life later on.   "

(Section 3.2.10)    Lower Your Electric Bill (Section 3.3.3)      For this exercise, you will make your own monthly budget. First, list out all our expenses and savings and classify them as needs, wants, and savings . If there are any items you want to keep personal and don’t want me to see, just list it as “personal expense,” but still give the actual monthly amount that personal item costs. Second, create your budget using whatever budget plan and technique you’d like, except for an app. (You may still use an app to budget, but in terms of submitting your budget for this assignment, an app would be a bit tedious.)  You have two options. If you have a job, either full-time or part-time, and have some of your own expenses that you pay for, you can use your actual paychecks and expenses to create your budget. If you do not currently work, you may create a hypothetical budget using income and expenses you might expect shortly after graduation. (If you do this hypothetical budget, research how much the starting pay is for a job you could see yourself doing just after graduation. Don’t use “average pay.” Also research realistic expenses in terms of housing, food, etc. For your pay, take how much is reported for a starting pay and multiply by 0.7. This will give you an approximate after-tax amount.)    You need to pick up some cat food at the store. The shop has a few options for your cat's favorite brand. A single can costs $2.09.

You and your significant other have returned home from long days at work. Neither of you wants to cook. Your significant other is adamant that the two of you go out for dinner and drinks to relax. You are concerned about your food budget for the month and realize that the cost of going out for food and drinks will likely be about $100-$120, which the two of your can't really afford right now. How would you handle the situation?    Consider the following three products: diapers, window cleaner, and milk.

A clean, updated home in a nice neighborhood has just gone on the market for $300,000. They have saved for a 20% down payment plus closing costs. So, they need to borrow $240,000. Banks are currently advertising 5.8% 30-year fixed rates. This would make the basic mortgage cost $1,408 per month. With taxes and insurance, their monthly mortgage payment is $2,074. This amount would just fit into their possible housing budget. When they apply for the loan, they are told that their credit is not great and that the interest rate is going to be 7.2%. This change in interest rate raises the basic loan payment to $1,629, a $221 difference. Alex and Alexa could move a little around in their budget, but not $221.

They don’t have a car and need to live somewhere with decent public transportation options to downtown. They have been putting in applications for several apartments, but they are rejected every time. They are told that tenants with better credit ratings are the ones chosen to rent the places. During their unemployed time, Jordan had to miss a number of bill payments, but they are starting to catch up. No landlord is willing to accept their explanation of their situation and choose to just “go with the numbers.” Jordan has to now choose between not taking their new job or living in a place in which the daily commute is hours long.  The two scenarios above are not particularly wild or extreme. In fact, they are very common. Having poor credit can cost you in terms of money, time, and stress. The importance of credit has become so mainstream that an entire industry has been built around it.    Source: https:\/\/hfco.com\/news-insights\/pas-child-and-dependent-care-enhancement-tax-credit-expanded-for-2023\/    When you hear the term “credit” in the context of personal finance, it refers to a measurement on how trustworthy you are with regards to paying your bills and paying back loans you take out. Giving someone a loan is a risky thing. If someone is unable to pay what they owe you, it can be a very time-consuming endeavor to recuperate even part of the money you are owed. If you are a landlord, it can take 6 to 18 months to evict someone who stops paying rent. So, landlords tend to only rent to those who have shown they can and will pay their bills. Some insurance companies even demand more in monthly premiums to someone with more risky bill-payment history. Some employers may check your credit as well as a gauge of how “responsible” you are. So, it is paramount to your financial health to build and maintain “good credit.”    How Credit is Measured   There are two measurements of your credit. The first measurement is your credit report . In actuality, you have a number of credit reports. Each “reporting bureaus” has their own report. The three biggest reporting bureaus are TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. These credit reports give a snapshot of your current and recent experiences in loan and bill payments. When you apply for a loan or some other thing that requires a “hard inquiry” into your credit, lenders will look at this credit report to make a decision. A credit report will list things like, how much you still owe on your house\/car, what your current monthly payments on loans are, credit card balances, credit card limits, bankruptcies, financial lawsuits, previous credit inquiries, and which monthly payments you have made on time.   Source: https:\/\/www.nfcc.org\/blog\/the-range-of-poor-to-excellent-credit-scores-and-what-it-means-for-your-finances\/     The second option of credit measurement is a credit score . A credit score is simply a single number that summarizes your credit. The larger the score, the better. Each reporting bureau can use its own method and scale for credit scores. There used to be more difference in possible ranges for credit scores, but most models now put all credit scores between 350 and 850. The point of a credit score is to give a somewhat-universal measurement of credit that shouldn’t open any more doors to biases in decisions regarding loans.   "

  "body": " Building Good Credit  Let's dive into building credit.   What Determines Your Credit?  In this section, we’ll go through the main contributors to your credit report and scores in order of how big of an impact they have.  - Payment History. ( Very high impact. ) The most important factor in your credit is your history of making payments on loans and certain bills. Missing even one payment can wreck havoc on your credit score. While not as bad, late payments also can drastically impact your credit. Note that a payment is not counted as “late” until it is 30 days past due. So, if you have a credit card payment due on July 1st, as long as you pay it by July 31st, the payment is not considered “late” in terms of impacting your credit.  When you pay certain bills, the lender or company will report to the credit bureaus that you have made a payment on time. If you are late with a payment or miss a payment, they will likewise report so. It takes dozens of reported on-time payments to build your credit up, but it only takes one bad month to lower your score. Now all bill payments are reported to credit bureaus. All loan payments, such as mortgages, auto loans, equity loans, and personal loans are reported to credit bureaus each month. Rent can be reported, but that is up to your landlord to do so. Generally, rent payments are not reported unless you miss payments. Similarly, utilities, phone, TV, and insurance bills can be reported, but are usually not. If you do miss payments, these companies are more likely to sell your debt to a collections agency, which absolutely will report your missing bill payments. Fines and tickets are not reported in Massachusetts.  Medical debt is tricky. It only takes one small thing to happen for medical debt to pile up. If you have an emergency medical procedure that your insurance doesn’t cover, you could be looking at hundreds of thousands of medical bills. A common false belief is that missed payments on medical debt can’t be reported for Massachusetts residents. This is false. It absolutely can. Many medical providers choose not to report themselves, but collections agencies absolutely will. However, since medical debt is seen as involuntary debt (choosing to take out an auto loan is never life-or-death), there is some leniency. First, medical debt of less than $500 will never hurt your credit. This is because it is really common to have to fight with your medical insurance company over co-pay amounts and whatnot, which takes time. Second, once your unpaid medical payments are reported to a credit bureau, the bureau cannot legally affect your credit report for 365 days from the day they are told about your missed payments. Paid medical debt is no longer report as well, meaning once you pay medical debt that went to collections, it is removed from your report. Further, some credit score models do not take into account unpaid medical debt. There are talks about eliminating all medical debt from credit reports, but that is looking less likely under the proposed goals of the new administration and legislature.  - Amount Owed. ( Very high impact. ) In general, the more you owe, the more risky it is to let you borrow more money. Even you you have a very high income and can afford a large mortgage or auto loan, large loan amounts will hurt your credit.  Percentage of credit utilization also affects your score. Owing $10,000 in credit card debt is much worse if your credit limit is $15,000 versus $50,000. (66.7%credit utilization versus 20%.) Ideally, you want to keep your credit utilization below 10%of your total “revolving-credit” accounts. ( Revolving credit is a type of open-ended loan in which you can borrow up to a pre-approved amount. Credit cards and home-equity loans are examples of these.)  - Length of Credit History. ( Moderate impact. ) This is one you don’t have much control over. Lenders, employers, etc. would prefer to see you have 25 years of good credit history versus one year of credit history. Credit history is usually determined to be either the age of your oldest account or the average age of all your accounts. For example, if you opened your first credit card five years ago and opened a second credit card one year ago and no other types of accounts, your “credit age” could be either 5 years or 3 years (average of 1 and 5), depending on the reporter’s model. I didn’t pull 25 years out of thin air. That is usually the credit age needed for the best positive impact to your score. Again, don’t stress over credit age. Once you have an account open, you just have to wait.  There are some nuances to this. If you pay off a loan, that account is called “closed.” Closed accounts stay on your credit report for up to ten years and continue to contribute to the “age” of your credit. After 10 years, closed accounts disappear, suddenly changing your “credit age.” Also, not using available credit can be seen negatively. Some credit card companies close your credit cards if you do not use them for some period of time (often a year). So, it is in your best interest, if you can, to keep your oldest account open.  - Credit Mix. ( Lower impact. ) Lenders like to see that you are capable of paying a variety of types of bills. Having one credit card and no other types of accounts or loans makes it look like you have too narrow of credit history. So, most credit reporting models favor having kinds of both installment debt (mortgage, student loans, etc.) and revolving accounts (credit cards and equity loans). Even though have a broader mix of credit types helps your credit score, the impact is not worth taking out new loans or opening more credit cards just to improve your credit score. Be smart about loans and credit cards.   - Credit Inquiries and New Accounts ( Lower impact. ) Statistically, if you take on more debt, you are more likely to miss a payment on older debt. So, opening new accounts tends to lower your credit rating.  First, when a company or person needs to check your credit report, they “pull you credit report” or “run an inquiry.” When you apply for a home loan, the bank will pull your credit report to determine if they are willing to give you a loan and what rate they are willing to give you. Even if you do not actually take out the loan, this credit check will hurt your credit rating a bit. There are two types of credit checks. A soft credit check is a check companies do to find out who they would like to offer you something. Credit card companies are the biggest users of soft inquiries in that they look for people with scores in certain ranges to market particular credit cards. Since you do not authorize these checks, soft credit inquiries do not affect your credit at all. A hard credit check is one that a lender will do when you apply for a loan or credit card. These do lower your credit rating.  The decrease in credit ratings from hard credit inquiries is usually small and very temporary, assuming you make payments on all your bills on time. Further, if you “rate-shop” and apply for loans at a few places in a short time-frame, those multiple checks are often counted as only one “credit inquiry.”    Starting Your Credit Journey If you have never taken out a loan or opened a credit card, you may be what is called a “ghost” - someone without a credit history. We all start out as ghosts. My generation (millennial) had a saying when we were hitting the job market. “To get a job, you need experience. To get experience, you need a job.” A similar adage is true for credit. “To build credit, you need credit.” That is, in order to show someone that you can be trusted with their money, you have to have already shown that you can be trusted with money.” Some people decide they want to start building credit, but find they are rejected due to having no credit history. This section is about starting your credit journey.  The first option comes with a huge disclaimer. Promise me you won’t make any decisions until you complete understand how credit cards work and their dangers. Promise? Good. Opening your first credit card account is a quick way to start building a credit history. If you can demonstrate that you can use a credit card responsibly, and make all payments on time, you’ll see a strong start in your credit. However, credit cards have the potential for enormous debt that is easy to fall into. Never open a credit card unless you are 100%sure you can use it responsibly. We will go over credit cards in the the next section. If you are determined to open a credit card but do not trust yourself not to overspend, you ask your parents\/guardians to hold onto it for you and only use it to buy one small thing a month, like a pack of gum or a coffee.  If you do not trust yourself with a credit card or cannot get a credit card, a secured credit card may be an option. When a financial instrument is “secured,” it means its tied to a relatively safe asset. A secured card is tied to a bank account, making it function much like a debit card. To open a secured credit card, you usually deposit money into a bank account, called a “security deposit.” You are issued a credit card with a limit equal to what you put into the account. You cannot spend the money from your security deposit. Each month, you pay your credit card bill from your (different) regular account. If you miss a payment, the bank used the money in your security deposit account. A secured card is a way to build credit with less risk of falling to credit card debt. So, it can also help with anxiety around credit cards. Secured credit cards are meant to be temporary. Once you’ve built some credit and feel less anxious about credit cards, it may be time to move onto a regular credit card. There is one caveat. Not all secured cards report to the credit bureaus, which makes them pointless for building credit. Make sure the one you want is from a bank that will report to at least one of the three reporting bureaus.  This one takes a lot of communication and trust. You can build some credit history by becoming an “authorized user” on someone else’s credit card account. Most commonly, parents or spouses add someone as an authorized user. The benefit is that all reports from the credit card company regarding on-time payments now goes to your report as well. However, being an authorized user means that you essentially have access to whatever credit the primary user has. For example, if your parents have a credit card with a $20,000 limit (much higher than the usual $500 limit for a first credit card), you have access to the spending power of that $20,000, but your parents are responsible for the payments. It takes a great deal of open communication, planning, and trust for this arrangement to work. One option some of my friends’ families did when we were young adults was to make their child an authorized user but did not actually give them the credit card or any of the information. The idea was to help their kids build credit without the risks of a teenager doing something foolish with a high-limit credit card. A few (emphasis on few) credit cards allows primary users to set separate spending limits for authorized users.  Some small banks and credit unions offer “credit-builder loans.” These loans don’t make much sense on the surface, but they are effective at building credit. With a credit builder loan, you apply for the loan but do not get the funds right away. They are held in an account. You then make payments for this loan (with interest) as you would for a normal loan. Once the loan is paid off, you get the loan amount you actually applied for. For example, suppose you take out a credit builder loan of $1,000 at 7%interest for one year. You do not get that $1,000 right away as you would with a traditional loan. Instead, you would make monthly payments of about $86.53 per month. Notice that you would pay in total. At the end of the year and after you made all you payments, you would get that $1,000. Yes, you lose money, but that is because it is a loan. You have to pay interest. Think of it as paying $38 to start building your credit. Because credit builder loans are small (usually about $1,000), big banks don’t deal with them. Some online banks do, but they are usually predatory and trick you into a really high interest rate. If you go this route, go with a local credit union.  In general, it takes about six months of on-time payments to establish a credit history. This in no way means you’ll have a great credit score in six months, but you will have some history, and you will have access to better credit cards, loans, more apartments, etc.    Maintaining Your Credit  Once you've established some credit, you want to maintain your credit and continue to build it overtime. We'll go over a few things that will help you stay on top of your credit.  - The first is more of a general philosophy. I’m going to give you a rule. It’s overly-simplistic and requires some caveats, but it is a solid rule for maintaining your financial health, particularly with respect to credit.  Never go into debt.  That requires some explanation. Some debt is okay and often unavoidable. A reasonable mortgage or car loan are examples of okay debt, but those are predictable and expenses you would likely have no matter what (housing and transportation). The above rule is directed at things like credit card debt, home equity, personal loans, payday loans, etc. A more apt rule might be, “never take on debt you can’t afford,” but that doesn’t stick with you as much as “never go into debt.” Make whatever changes are necessary to avoid falling into debt. The debt will become a burden.  - In a similar vein, the second recommendation is to never buy something with a credit card that you don’t have the cash to pay for. If you don’t have the full cost of a TV saved up and able to be used without draining your savings, then do not buy the TV with a credit card. It is easy to amass well over $10,000 in credit card debt with minimum payments that grow and grow. If you only purchase what you know you can afford, you can go through life without paying a penny in credit card interest and never amass debt. A good mindset is to think of your credit cards as a debit card in which each swipe\/tap directly withdraws from your cash account. They aren’t, but having that mindset can help control spending.  - Set up automatic payments for bills. It is easy to get a bill in the mail and forget about it for a while until it’s late. Automatic payment eliminates that scenario. If you can, set your credit card payments to automatically pay your full balance each month. This way, you’ll never pay any interest and won’t amass any debt. (Only do this once you have a solid budget and are comfortable enough with your spending that you won’t have money you need for rent or some other necessity automatically withdrawn.)  - Check your credit reports regularly. By law, the credit bureaus have to give you free access to your credit reports once each year. Make use of that. Most credit cards these days have a benefit that allows you to access a pared-down version of your report whenever you want. If you have access to that benefit, do so at least one a month. You want to look out for irregularities. Mistakes happen sometimes. One small billing error may make your auto loan bank mistakenly report you as missing a payment. Maybe something went to collections, and you didn’t know. Maybe someone committed identity fraud and opened an account in your name. It is important to keep a lookout for irregularities on your credit reports and contest anything that is incorrect.  - Put a “credit freeze” on your accounts. A credit freeze is when you tell the reporting bureaus not to allow anyone to access your credit report. This prevents anyone from taking out any loan in your name or applying for credit cards in your name. It also significantly reduces the amount of junk mail you get since companies can’t access your report to target you for advertising. However, by “anyone,” I mean everyone, including you. So, if you need to apply for anything that requires a credit check, you actively need to remove the freeze or do a temporary removal (called a “thaw”).  - If you become comfortable with your own responsible credit card spending habits, every now and then ask for a credit limit increase. Having a higher credit limit lowers your overall credit utilization, which is seen positively by lenders. Of course, never request a spending limit increase if you are building credit card debt; the last thing you want in that situation is more room to amass more debt.  -If you go “rate-shopping,” try do so in a short time span (about two weeks). Shopping around for the best interest rate with hard credit checks needed for each will be treated as one inquiry if they are all made around the same time. If they’re spread out over a couple months, you can hurt your credit a fair amount.  -Have an emergency or rainy-day fund that can pay about three months of your required payments. If you find yourself out of work, on disability, parental leave, etc., your bills don’t stop. Have a fund to help you make it through until you can find employment again.    Activity: Start Building Your Credit  Now that we’ve discussed how to start building credit, it’s time for you to make a plan. In a paragraph, explain what you would like to do to start building credit. If you are already building credit, explain how you are doing so and what you are doing to maintain your credit.   "

  "body": " Credit Cards  Love them or hate them, credit cards are one of the pillars of the global economy. (I’ve even heard that some people believe credit cards are the “mark of the Beast” from the book of Revelations.) In this section, we’ll go over what credit cards are, how they work, how to get them, and responsible use of credit cards.   Revolving Credit  Credit cards are the most prominent example of a “revolving” loan. When you are issued a credit card, the issuing company is agreeing to give you a loan up to a set dollar amount called a credit limit . Unlike an installment loan in which you have to use the borrowed money for a set thing (car, house, education, etc.), a revolving loan gives much more freedom to what you can use the borrowed money for. Also unlike installment loans, paying off the balance of a revolving account does not close the account, you can continue to borrow up to your credit limit.  There are other kinds of revolving loans. Payday and other personal loans are usually revolving loans. Just like payday loans, credit card loans have many dangers, such as high interest rates and a very easy path to amassing too much debt. However, when used responsibly, credit card loans present a much better option for making purchases than other revolving lines of credit.  The main benefit of a credit card is being able to make purchases without needing to carry cash with you. Of course, personal checks also fit that bill, but fewer and fewer places are accepting personal checks. Of course, online shopping is very difficult without a credit or debit card.    The Economics of Credit Cards  The economics of credit cards is somewhat complex, but it can be helpful to know some of the monetary motivation for their existence.  First, let’s talk about payment card companies. In the United States, the payment card industry is dominated by four companies: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. These companies collect, store, process, and transmit all data related to debit cards and credit cards. So, these companies are data-storage companies. In terms of making loans via cards, some payment card companies do this themselves (such as American Express and Discover). Others have “member banks,” that use the payment card’s data services to issue loans (such as Visa and Mastercard).  All payment card companies make money via fees. Have you ever been to a store that charges higher prices or a purchase minimum price when paying with a credit card? This is because payment card companies charge a fee to businesses for their services. Payment card companies charge different amounts, which can cause businesses to only use certain companies. Visa and Mastercard generally charge lower fees, which is why many small businesses do not accept Discover or American Express cards. Fees are often percentage based (1.5%-3.5%) along with a per-transaction fee ($0.10 - $0.80). Historically, businesses set their prices uniformly to account for these fees. Some businesses have begun offering lower cash-only prices to be more competitive (gas stations, for example). Some cards have fees that are paid by the cardholder, called annual fees . Lastly, member banks that use payment card services pay a fee for those services.  Member banks (and payment card companies that are their own banks) make money via annual fees and interest. Not all credit cards have annual fees, but all will have interest. The interest rates on credit cards tends to be very high (usually 15%- 30%). Given that home and auto loan interest rates are about 6%currently, credit cards can generate a massive profit for these member banks. However, you do not have to actually pay any interest on credits card. We’ll explain how soon.    How to Get a Credit Card  To get a credit card, you need to apply for one. As mentioned above, a credit card is the mechanism for a revolving line of credit, meaning that it is a loan. As with all loans, you need to apply for it. You apply for a credit card via a member bank (or the payment card company itself if it is its own bank). The biggest member banks are companies such as Chase, Capital One, Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc. Smaller banks can issue their own credit cards, but usually don’t. Smaller banks do usually issue debit cards, which still require the services of a payment card company.  As with any loan, applying for a credit card usually requires a credit check. (If a credit card issuer doesn’t require one, it is likely a very scammy and dangerous card.) Depending on what services and benefits come with a particular credit card (which we’ll discuss soon), credit card issuers may restrict approvals to people with sufficiently good credit history.    How a Credit Card Works  When you are approved for a credit card and have one, you are ready to make purchases with it. When you use a credit card at a business, whether in-person or virtually, you are actually requesting your credit card issuing bank to give you a loan for that purchase amount. The request is automatically transmitted to the issuing bank, which will very quickly determine if you will get the loan to pay for whatever it is you’re buying. In making this decision, the issuing bank’s computer will look at whether the purchase will exhaust your credit limit, where you are making the purchase, and the amount. There are a variety of reasons for a transaction not to be approved, but most are. If you exceed your credit limit or the purchase requests seems out of character for your buying habits, the transactions may be denied. You can always call the banks if you think the purchase should be approved. (For example, if you travel far away from home and use a credit card, the bank may think your card was stolen and just needs to be told that it is indeed you making the purchase.)  Once you have made a purchase using the borrowed money from your credit card issuer, you have taken out a loan for the purchase amount. Like any loan, you have to pay it back, and your loan will accumulate interest. We will go over interest in a later week. For now, just understand interest as essentially the cost to you for borrowing money. The higher the interest rate, the higher the cost.  Unlike an installment loan, there is not a set schedule in which you pay off your loan. The bank will determine what is called your minimum payment amount . The minimum payment is the absolute smallest amount you have to pay monthly to pay off your loan. How much the minimum payment is depends on a few factors, but it is mostly determined by how much you owe the bank in total. You can absolutely (and should) pay more than the minimum payment each month.  Here is the thing about minimum payments. Paying only the minimum payment on a credit card will lead you to never paying off the loan. You’ll just accumulate more and more debt through the high interest rates. So, it is generally in your best interest to pay more than what is minimally required.  If you are wondering why anyone would use a credit card if the loan interest rates are so high, I have an important fact about every credit card in the U.S.  You never have to pay a penny in interest on a credit card.  Here is why and how. By law, every credit card issuer has to allow a grace period . Every credit card company has a monthly billing cycle. All purchases made with a credit card in one monthly cycle are treated as one big loan, essentially. For purchases in one billing cycle, the actually terms of the loan (interest) cannot kick in until the end of the grace period, which is usually 3-4 weeks. If you pay off your credit card balance before the end of that grace period, the bank cannot charge you any interest at all.   So, if you pay off the full balance of your credit card every month, you will never, ever pay a single penny in interest.  If you are responsible with a credit card and only make purchases you have the money for in your personal savings account (or cash), then paying off your credit card each month is easy. First, most banks let you choose which day of the month your bills are due. Many people choose the 1st or last day of a month. Second, you can set up automatic payments so that the credit card issuing bank withdraws whatever you balance is each month (rather than a set dollar amount). By setting up automatic payments, you don’t have to worry or think about credit card debt or interest.    Activity: Credit Cards and Interest  While eating dinner with your significant other’s family, your SO’s father mentions that he’s never owned a credit card. He explains that because of the high interest rates on credit cards, it’s always cheaper to pay everything by cash and check. Is he correct? Explain your answer in a few sentences.     Credit Card Benefits  Beyond the convenience of credit cards, some issuing banks offer other perks. Essentially, the issuing banks expect (on average) to generate a lot of profit via interest. There is also a great deal of competition for you and your potential to pay interest. So, some card issuing banks offer incentives for choosing their cards. These benefits vary wildly. A “cash back” card will essentially return a small percentage of a purchase amount to you. (1%-5%, depending on the card and location of purchases. Most are around 1.5%these days.) Some cards offer discounts on certain products via agreements they make with companies. (For example, Marriott may offer a discount on hotels if the purchase is made through your credit card bank in exchange for the bank advertising Marriott to you.) Some cards offer services such as travel planning, event ticket buying, stream service membership, etc.  Cards that offer these additional benefits many not be a simple add-on service. Cards that offer benefits are more likely to charge annual fees. You have to make a decision as to whether an annual fee is worth it. Some benefit-bearing cards to not have any annual fee.  Unfortunately, the better the benefits of a card, the more scrutiny is used in determining if you are eligible for the card. That is, some cards require you to have sufficient high credit to be eligible.  For those just entering the credit-card benefit world, I tend to suggest finding a cash-back card that does not charge an annual fee. If you pay off your balance every month, you never pay interest, but you do still get the “cash back.” This combination essentially makes your purchases cheaper.    Credit Limits  There is an upper bound to how much you can purchase with a credit card. Your credit limit is the most your card issuing bank is willing to loan you. One common misconception is that a credit limit is the most you can spend per purchase. That is incorrect. A credit limit is the most you can purchase in total. If, either by a purchase or interest, your credit card balance reaches your credit limit, your are “maxed out.”  In general, credit limits are tied to a few key factors. Your credit rating, annual income, loan balances, and other assets will determine what your card-issuing bank will set as a credit limit. For your first credit card, credit limits are often $500 or $1,000. Credit limits can be much, much higher for those with good credit and large incomes.  Credit limits are very malleable. Often, your card bank will change your credit limit automatically. In times of economic downturns, banks often lower credit limits as a form of risk management in case many of their cardholders lose the jobs. In times of economic booms, banks may increase credit limits. If a bank determines that you do not use much of your credit limit each month, it may lower your credit limit. If you make purchase close to your credit limit or have amassed a large credit card balance, the bank may increase your credit limit to encourage more spending.  Automatic credit limit increases can be a bit of a trap, particularly if you are carrying a balance month to month that accrues interest. It is in the best interest of the credit card bank for you to amass credit card debt while making the low monthly payments. Particularly for people with a spender money personality, increasing credits limits can encourage poor money management and exacerbate debt issues you already have.  Fortunately, you can often request changes in your credit limit. In particular, requesting a lower credit limit is easy. If you find yourself making too many purchases with your credit card each month, requesting a lower limit may help keep spending down. On the flip side, you can sometimes request a limit increase. This can be helpful as you get older and start making more money and making more purchases. Requesting a credit limit increase usually requires approval and will consider factors like current credit balance, purchase history, and income.   "

  "body": " Using a Credit Card Responsibly  If you are getting excited about a credit card, this section is to help bring you down to reality. Credit cards have the potential to be very dangerous.  Let’s consider a realistic scenario. Suppose Manny gets his first credit card with a $1,000 limit and an interest rate of 25%. He doesn’t not have much in savings and makes just enough to get buy. Excited to have access to $1,000 to spend, Manny buts a Playstation 5 and a game for (after tax) $600. After the grace period and his credit card bill is due, Manny only pays the minimum amount of $25, leaving his balance at 600 - 25 = $575.  Manny checks his credit report via his credit card’s website and finds that his credit score dropped 10 points because he has “high credit utilization.” While disappointed, Manny is still happy he has his Playstation and $425 left that he can use. Before getting his credit card, Manny couldn’t get a lot of things. He decides to start ordering Door Dash and spends $200 is the next billing cycle. When the next bill is due, the interest from his previous month causes his balance to grow to $587. Adding this month’s Door Dash purchases makes his total balance $787. Once again, he makes the minimum payment of $25. So, now he has a balance of 787 - 25 = $762.  His credit score drops even more as his credit utilization ration has grown. Seeing that Manny has approached his credit limit, his bank adjusts his credit limit to $3,000, meaning Manny has 3,000 - 762 = $2,238. Excited with having more spending power, Manny begins purchasing things he’s always wanted but could never afford such as more games for his Playstation, accessories for his car, some rare collectible figurines, etc. He spends another $1,000 this month. The interest on his $762 balance raises it to $778. Adding the new $1,000 brings a total loan balance to $1,778. He pays all he can afford - the $25 minimum payment for a final balance of $1,753.  Manny starts to get worried. His credit rating is declining each month. That $1,753 is a large amount he owes. He determines to get his spending back into shape. He cuts up the credit card, preventing him from using it. He promises himself he will continue to pay off the credit card debt slowly and steadily. The next month, interest has caused his balance to increase to $1,790. Manny can again only afford the minimum payment of $25. So, his next balance is $1,765.  Manny is dismayed that his balance is going up despite now making any more purchases. His credit rating is hurting. Each month, despite making payments, his balance is going up and up. Manny’s anxiety starts going through the roof. He knows he will need to eventually find a better job, but he is worried his credit be a problem. He knows he needs to make larger payments on his credit card, but he doesn’t have room in his budget. Manny feels trapped underneath his credit debt and doesn’t see a way out.  Manny’s situation is far from unusual or contrived.   Activity: Is Credit Card Debt Unusual?  Do a brief Internet search for the following:     Percentage of American’s with credit card debt.    Percentage of American’s with at least $5,000 in credit card debt.    Percentage of American’s with at least $10,000 in credit card debt.    Percentage of American’s with at least $20,000 in credit card debt.     You have two tasks for this activity:     Report your findings on the above.    Suppose you are one of the American’s with $10,000 in credit card debt. The average interest rate for credit cards is around 22%. About how much would you pay in just interest in a year?       Debrief  I’m hoping you are coming to understand how easy it is to fall into credit card debt. People usually fall into credit card debt for one of two reasons. First is similar to Manny’s issue: overspending. Credit cards make it really easy to purchase items that don’t fit into your budget. Fortunately, this debt is easy to avoid. Just don’t buy the wants you can’t afford. Of course, that is often easier said than done, particularly for those with strong present bias or social bias. The key is to interpret a credit card as a tool that makes purchasing more efficient with money you already have. A credit card should never be seen as a method to get what you can’t afford.  The other common way people fall into credit card debt is a sudden, unexpected bill. From a large medical deductible from a sudden injury to a massive car repair bill, many people put large expenses they don’t have the cash for onto their credit cards to give themselves more time to pay. The easiest way to avoid this situation is to have a solid emergency or rainy-day fund. Remember that you should try to have at least three months (or even sixth months) worth of your monthly needs amount saved up for emergencies. If you find yourself in a situation in which you have a large bill due but no emergency fund to pay for it, there may be some options. With a large medical bill, remember that there is a full year period after a bill is reported as late for you to pay before any negative information can be put on your report. Also, many hospitals will work with you to set up payment plans. For other large bills, you can ask about payment plans. Many businesses are willing to work with you. You may also be able to hold off on accumulating such bills for a while as you save money. For example, if your car breaks down and needs a large repair, it may be possible to use public transportation for a few months as you save money to repair it. (A few months without paying for gas or insurance adds up.)    Activity: Helping Manny  Manny’s situation is not uncommon at all. It really only takes a few purchases that you can’t afford to bury yourself under credit card debt. Getting out from credit card debt is not easy, but it is possible. This activity has two tasks.     First, analyze what went wrong with Manny’s scenario. How should he have behaved with his new credit card?    Next, come up with three realistic ways Manny could help lower his credit card debt. Try not to use deus-ex-machina examples, like getting his parents to pay his debt or him suddenly finding a much better-paying job. Just as a point of reference, doubling his monthly payment to $50 would still take almost 6 years for manny to pay off the debt and would cause him to pay a total of about $1,500 in interest on top of the $1,800 his purchases actually cost.       Debrief  I am hoping that some of your ways to help get Manny out of debt required some sacrifice on Manny’s part. Often, getting out from credit card debt requires you to make some significant changes in your life and your budgeting. It’s never easy. If often requires you to significantly lower what you can spend on wants each month. In extreme cases, you may even need to move into lower-quality housing with cheaper rent payments.   "

( )    Helping Manny ( )       Your friend wants to start building her credit. She has heard that owning a credit card is a good way to start building credit. However, she is concerned that she may not be able to control her spending impulses if she had a credit card. What are some ways in which you could advise your friend? Give at least three recommendations.    Take a look at this calculator: https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/credit-cards\/tools\/minimum-payment-calculator\/   With this calculator, you can estimate how much you will pay on credit card purchases if you only make the minimum payments. The average interest rate is currently 22%. Most often, credit card banks calculate the minimum payment amount as 2%of your current balance (for balances of $1,000). Using those figures, determine how much you would pay for each of the following credit card purchases, if you only paid the minimum amount. (Note that the figure it gives you is just interest. So, also include the purchase amount. For example, if you buy something for $1,000 and the total interest paid is $500, the total amount you pay would be $1,500.     Buy something for $1,000    Buy something for $5,000    Buy something for $10,000     (Hint: Yes, these numbers get very big.)    Below are some common things people do in life.

  "title": "Properties of Loans",
  "body": " Properties of Loans  Most of us will need to take out loans throughout our lives. Car loans, mortgages, student loans, etc. are all extremely common and make up a huge part of the American and global economies. However, not all loans are created equal. Understanding the components or terms of loans can help you save a lot of money in the long run.   Principal  When you borrow money, the amount that you borrow is called the principal. It is the base amount that you need to pay back. As you repay your loan over time, some of your payments will go toward what you owe (the principal) and reduce that amount. Once you pay back the entire principal amount, you have repaid the loan.    Balance  At any moment in time, the amount you owe on a loan is your balance . As you make payments on your loan, the balance of your loan (usually) decreases. Once your balance has reached $0, you will have paid off your loan and don’t owe any more payments. For example, suppose you take out a loan of $1,000. The principal on your loan is $1,000, and that is your balance. Suppose that your first payment is $250 where $200 “goes toward the principal” and $50 is interest\/fees. Then after the payment, your balance drops to $800.  Here is an important thing about balances. Your balance will increase if you don’t make payments. This is because of interest. Take the last scenario where you had $50 in interest. If you didn’t make that $250 payment, your balance would have increase to $1,050 (the $1,000 previous balance plus the $50 in interest). As we’ll discuss next, higher balances means even more that you’ll pay in interest.    Term  The term of your loan is the length or amount of time it will take to pay off the loan. For installment loans, like car loans and mortgages, the term is agreed upon at the start of the loan. For example, mortgages generally have terms of 10, 15 or 30 years. Car loans typically have terms of 4 to 7 years. Payday loans typically have terms of a few weeks or a month.    Collateral  When a bank loans you money, they are taking on the risk of you not paying them back. Sometimes, a loan will require something of great value that you agree you would give up if you cannot pay back your loan. This item of great value is called “collateral.” Some loans naturally have collateral. With a mortgage, the house is the collateral. For car loans, the car is collateral. With smaller, personal loans, it is sometimes the case that you need to choose an item of value (e.g. car, jewelry, etc.) to place as collateral. Loans with collateral agreements tend to require less in interest payments due to the decrease in risk of not getting paid back.    Interest  Most loans are not free. Imagine you are a bank, and someone asks for $1,000 with a promise to pay it back. Why would you give them that loan? If they only paid back $1,000 and nothing else, that is simply bad business for your bank. Instead of loaning that $1,000, you could have used it to invest it. Further, there is a risk that the person won’t pay back that $1,000. So, as compensation for both losing the opportunity to invest that $1,000 and taking on the risk of not getting the money back, you want to charge the borrow extra money. This extra money is interest .  Interest is what makes loans possible. By giving out a loan with interest, the loan is a kind of investment. By taking on the risk of lending money, the bank expects investment compensation via interest.  Interest is one of the most important, and most complex, terms of a loan. How large interest payments are and how they’re calculated can heavily impact how much someone can borrow and how well they’ll be able to pay off the loan. We discuss this next.    Fees  Some loans cost money to actually process and start. For example, taking out a loan for a mortgage requires work to transfer the deed to you. It requires a title office and a lawyer, among other things. These fees are generally paid by the person taking out the loan. This can happen in two ways. In one way, the loanee pays all the fees up front when the loan begins. However, since most people don’t have the needed money to pay fees up front, fee costs are paid in small increments as the loanee pays back the loan.    APR  For the vast majority of loans, interest is calculated based on the APR or annual percentage rate . For simplicity, let’s assume that loan payments are made once a year. Suppose you have a loan balance of $10,000. If your APR is 6%, then the amount of interest you need to pay at the end of the year is . Now, if your APR was 15% instead, then the amount of interest you need to pay at the end of the year is . As you can see, when you take out a loan, you generally want the lowest APR possible.  What your APR will be is determine by a few factors. The type of loan (mortgage, car, payday, etc.) is a big factor. Below are some ranges of current APR’s for types of loans:      Loan Type  APR    Mortgage  5.5% - 8%    Car  4.1%-21.9%    Payday  400%-1,000%    Home Equity  6.5% - 14.8%    Credit Card  6% - 36%    Title Loan  100% - 500%      You’ll notice vastly different rates for different types of loans. As we’ll explore later, there are reasons behind these differences.  Your credit is also a major determinant of your APR. Because interest payments are compensation for the risk of lending you money and your credit is a measurement of how likely you are to pay back money, it makes sense that those with higher credit would need to pay less in interest (lower APR). Those with lower credit would need higher APR’s.  Other factors of APR’s include the length or term of your loan and whether there is any collateral.  There is one little fib I made about APR. Technically, APR doesn’t count just interest. It also includes fees on the loan. You may see loans rates advertised with two percentages: the “rate” and the APR. The loan rate is what is used to calculate just interest. The APR is used to calculate interest and fees combined. Effectively, the APR can be used to calculate your actual loan payments.   "

  "title": "How Interest Compounds",
  "body": " How Interest Compounds  Just as a trigger warning, there will be some math in this section. You do not need to worry about formulas are the direct calculations. What you need to take away is the power of compound interest.    Compounding  Most loans have what is called compound interest . Rather than defining it, let’s look at an example. Suppose you take out a loan of $10,000 with an APR of 12%. After a year, the amount of interest owed is . Now, suppose you don’t make any payments. Then the balance of your loan becomes . When interest “compounds,” we mean that further interest owe is calculated not just on the principal, but previous interest amounts. So, after the second year, the amount of interest accumulated would be . Notice that this is quite a bit higher than the first year’s interest. Again, if you don’t make a payment, the balance would become . The third year’s interest would be . It just keeps going and going.  What is vital to understand is that, because interest compounds, it can be very easy for loan balances to get out of control. The higher the APR, the easier it is to fall into unmanageable debt.    Conversion Periods and Effective APR  Unfortunately, APR is not quite as simple as we’ve been using it. This is because of what is called “conversion periods” or “compounding periods.” In our prior calculations, we have been imagining that interest payments are calculated at the end of each year. In reality, most interest payment amounts are calculated each month or each day.  Here is how it works. Suppose that you take out a car loan for $20,000 that offers a 12% APR that is “compounded monthly.” Since there are 12 months in a years, the amount of interest charged in a month is . So, after one month, you owe in interest. If you don’t make a payment, your balance is $20,200. Your next interest amount owed after the next month is then . If you made no payments for a year, you would actually have total interest accumulated as $2,536. Notice that this is not 12% of $20,000. It is actually 12.68% of $20,000. This 12.68% rate is sometimes called the “effective APR.”  If in the example above, interest were compounded every day, the total interest owed at the end of one year would be $2,550, which is even more. It is about 12.74% of the $20,000.  What to take away from this is that not all APR’s are equal. A 5% APR that is compounded monthly accumulates less interest than a 5%APR compounded daily. It is something to keep in mind.    Activity: Why APR Matters  For this activity, you will look at how APR and loan length can affect how much you actually pay on loans. You will look at two common loan types. First, open up this calculator: https:\/\/www.calculator.net\/payment-calculator.html      Suppose you would like to borrow $250,000 to purchase a home, which is a very reasonable amount.   Suppose you have a 15-year term. Currently, possible APR’s for a 15-year mortgage are about 6.1%to 8.0%. For each of the following APR’s: 6.1%, 7.2%and 8.0%, use the calculator to find what your monthly payments will be and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.    Suppose you have a 30-year term. Currently, possible APR’s for a 30-year mortgage are about 6.9%to 9.5%. For each of the following APR’s: 6.9%, 8.1%, and 9.5%, use the calculator to find what your monthly payments will be and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.       Suppose you would like to borrow $20,000 to purchase a car, which is a very reasonable amount.     Suppose you have a 5-year term. Current APR’s for a 5-year auto loan are about 4.8%to 6.8%. Using each of 4.8%and 6.8%, use the calculator to find what your monthly payments will be and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.  Suppose you have a 7-year term. Current APR’s for a 5-year auto loan are about 5.8%to 7.8%. Using each of 4.8%and 6.8%, use the calculator to find what your monthly payments will be and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.       Report all your findings in a table.    In your own words, summarize your observations.      "

  "title": "How to Get a Loan",
  "body": " How to Get a Loan  Ultimately, to get a loan, you need to apply for one. There are a number of factors that will determine if you will be approved for a loan and the loan terms.   Credit  The better credit you have, the more likely you are to be approved for a loan and the better terms you’ll get on a loan. Recall that your credit rating is determined by the following:  -Payment history. Lenders want to see a long history of your bill payments being made on time.  -Current loan balances. Lenders prefer to see that you have not borrowed too much money and like to see smaller loan balances.  -Credit age. Lenders like to see a lot of history with lines of credit. The longer you have been managing money well, the better.  -Credit mix. Lenders like to see a diverse history of finances. A broader range of types of loans and bills in your recent history, the better.  -Credit inquiries. Frequently applying for loans is a red flag to lenders. Try to only apply for lines of credit only when you need it.    Debt-to-Income Ratio  Lenders want to make sure that you’ll be able to pay back any loan you take out. The biggest factor in being able to pay back a loan is simply being able to afford the loan payments in your budget. One way lenders measure this ability is to look at your debt-to-income ratio . Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is calculated as the total amount you pay on your debts each month divided by your monthly gross income (before taxes).  Note that your DTI is based on your gross (before taxes) income. This can be confusing, considering that most personal budgets are based on take-home (after taxes) income. For example, if your gross monthly income is $4,000, taxes are $1,000, and you pay $1,500 on debts each month. Then you have $3,000 for your monthly budget, and your DTI is or 37.5% A rough rule of thumb is that lenders prefer to see a debt-to-income ratio under 36%, >including the loan for which you are applying . For example, suppose your gross monthly pay is $2,000 and that you already pay $300 on student loans and $320 on a car loan each month. Then your current DTI is or 31%. Suppose you want a credit card. The credit card company will look at how much debt you can handle. If a “safe’’ DTI is 36 While the credit card bank may not reject your credit card application in this scenario, it is unlikely that they’ll give you a high credit limit.    Employment History  For some loans, particularly long-term loans like car loan and mortgages, it is not just your current income that matters but your employment history. Jobs can come and go; lenders know this. Suppose you just landed a great, high-paying job a week ago that will allow you to afford a new car and a house. Lenders are unlikely to approve of these loans for a while. The reason is that one of the biggest reasons people lose their jobs is that they simply don’t work out. Maybe your new job turns out to be toxic for you. Maybe they don’t find your work satisfactory or you don’t survive a probationary period. Maybe the position itself was unstable. In general, people who have been in a position for a while are more likely to stay employed. So, lenders want to see stability in your employment history. Even after landing a great new job, you may have to wait a few months before taking out a loan.    Other Factors  As discussed earlier, collateral can act as a way to reduce the risk of lending you money. For some loans, you can put up something as collateral to make the bank more comfortable with loaning you money. For some loans, collateral is part of the loan. Your house is collateral for a mortgage. Your car is collateral for a car loan. Your house is collateral for a home-equity loan.  The purpose of the loan will also play a factor. For some kinds of loans, the purpose is clear: mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc. For others, you may need to describe the purpose of the loan, and the bank will take that into consideration. Purposes for which the bank could more reliably get their money back in case of emergencies will be seen more favorably. For example, applying for a home equity loan to upgrade your kitchen is seen as less risky; your house will be used as collateral, and the lent money for the kitchen will increase its value. On the other hand, borrowing money to buy a bunch of crypto currency would be seen as incredibly risk since the bank wouldn’t be able to recover much of its money if the crypto you buy tanks.    Activity: Why Did They Get Rejected?  For each scenario, someone is rejected on a loan application. Determine the most likely reason why.     Carla and her husband have a combined gross income of $120,000 per year. They have a mortgage that requires monthly payments of $2,000 per month. They have some credit card debt that requires payments of about $500 per month. They have no other debt. Carla just finished becoming a registered nurse and recently started her first job at a hospital. Neither her nor her husband have ever missed a bill payment. They are looking to start their family and want to get an SUV that will allow them to transport kids around. They are applying for a car loan that will require monthly payments of $350. Their application was rejected.    Juan is a lawyer who has a gross income of $150,000 per year. He has been at his firm for three years. He has a mortgage that requires monthly payments of $3,500. He has no other debt. He is a huge skateboard fan. He decides he wants to build a huge skate park in his backyard. To fund it, John wants to take out a home-equity loan. The park will cost $25,000, and his home has over $100,000 in equity. The loan would add $500 per month in monthly debt payments. His home-equity loan application was rejected.    George makes a gross income of about $80,000. He has been with his work for five years. He has student loan debt that costs $400. He has a car loan that costs $300 per month. He has some credit card debt that requires about $200 per month. George is looking to buy his first home. The cheapest homes on the market would require monthly mortgage payments of $2,200. George is having trouble finding a bank who will give him a loan.      "

  "title": "Predatory-Lending",
  "body": " Predatory-Lending  There are some people out there that don’t miss a chance to take advantage of someone in a rough position. In the world of loans, some people try to sweep people in predatory loans . Predatory loans are loans made to people with little regard to their financial health. Most predatory loans come with extremely high APR’s and can quickly trap people in a cycle of debt.   Targets  Most predatory lenders target one of two kinds of people. The first are people in a tough financial position. For example, if someone comes back to their apartment from work to find an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent, but their next paycheck won’t come for a while, that person may be desperate enough to take out a high-interest loan to pay that late rate. Pay-day lenders, among others, target people in tough financial positions like this. The second targets are people with lower financial literacy and knowledge of loans. In particular, lenders may try to target people with higher present bias than others, advertising quick access to large amounts of cash while hiding the high APR in the background. This lending tactic is extremely common, and even the biggest banks look for these targets. (If you have a credit card, I guarantee that the company occasionally tries to advertise cash-advance loans to you. Don’t.)    Examples   -Pay-day Loans   Consider the example above in which someone needs cash now to pay rent to avoid eviction but pay-day isn’t for a while. Pay-day lenders capitalize on this exact kind of scenario. When you take out a pay-day loan, you borrow a bit less than the amount in one of your paychecks and promise to give your next paycheck or two to the lender. For example, if your paychecks are usually about $1,000, you might borrow $900 from the pay-day lender with the promise to give your $1,000 paycheck to them when you get it in a couple weeks. These loans are advertised as very short-term loans and can be approved for people with bad credit.  What makes pay-day loans predatory is their ridiculously-high APR’s. The average APR for a pay-day loan is about 400%. Some even get into the thousands. Just as a point of reference, mortgage rates are currently around 6-8% and car loans are around 4-9%  The true devilry with pay-day loans is in their advertised short term. Even with a 400% interest rate, if you only borrow for a week, it isn’t that much, is it? I mean, what is 100 for the security of getting the cash you need right now? The issue is that many people who take out these loans do so because they’re in dire financial trouble. A pay-day loan won’t fix that. Pay-day lenders actually count on you being unable to pay back your loan on time. First, they’ll be able to charge you a fee for being late. More importantly, you will be in debt to them with that really high interest rate.  Suppose your bi-weekly paychecks are $1,000 each. You need money now for food or rent. So, you take out a pay-day loan with an APR of 400%. Then they’ll give you about $860-$870 now, and you’ll owe your $1,000 paycheck in two weeks. Suppose that two weeks comes. You’ve spent that $870 because it’s less than your usual $1,000. When your paycheck comes, you simply can’t give the full $1,000 to the lender. Say you only give back $500. The lender charges you a $100 fee for being late. You now owe the lender at that 400% interest rate. With that interest rate, you will owe an extra 15%-16% every two-week period. So, two weeks later, when your next check comes, that $600 you owed is now just short of $700. At your next paycheck, it will be $800. At the next, over $900. This scenario is in no way farfetched; it’s very common and is exactly how a pay-day lender wants to operate. In fact, over 80% of pay-day loans go beyond their original pay-back date, just like in the scenario above .  The best way to deal with pay-day loans is to never take one out for any reason. Of course, that recommendation comes from a great place of privilege. Threats of homelessness or being unable to feed your child puts extreme pressures on you. Nevertheless, always try to avoid pay-day loans. Plead with your landlord for a few more weeks to pay rent. Visit the local food bank to feed your family until the next pay day. Ask someone you know if you can do some chores in exchange for some cash. It may seem embarrassing, but falling under the thumb of a pay-day lender would be far worse.  - Sub-prime Mortgages   Let’s consider a very different example. Most American’s dream of owning a home; most of us need to borrow money to pay for one. Taking out a mortgage requires that you can make the needed payments for as long as 30 years. If you do not make enough money, have too much current debt, or won’t likely be employed for 30 years, you may not be approved for a mortgage. A sub-prime mortgage or a non-qualified mortgage is mortgage given by a bank to someone who has a high risk of being able to pay back the loan.  People are not told that they are taking out a sub-prime mortgage. This is because sub-prime mortgages are simply mortgages with no difference. The thing is that, because of the higher risk of non-payment, the interest rates on sub-prime mortgages are higher. Currently, prime mortgages rates for 30-year loans are around 6%. Sub-prime mortgages are around 10%-12%. A 12%rate may not seem that high, especially compared to the pay-loan case above. However, consider the following scenario: Suppose you find a home that you love that will require you to borrow $250,000. If you take out a 30-year loan, here will be your monthly payments for a few interest rates:      Loan Type  APR    Mortgage  5.5% - 8%    Car  4.1%-21.9%    Payday  400%-1,000%    Home Equity  6.5% - 14.8%    Credit Card  6% - 36%    Title Loan  100% - 500%      - Title Loans   A title loan is somewhat like a home-equity loan in that you take out a loan with your car as collateral. That is, if you cannot make payments on the title loan, the lender can take ownership of your car. Similar to pay-day loans, what makes title loans predatory is their high interest rates; title loans often come with interest rates of around 200%-300%. Again, these loans are targeted to people with poor credit in dire financial situations.  Most commonly, people who become trapped in title loans end up taking out other loans to make the payments on their title loans out of fear of losing their cars. About 20%-25%of people who take out title loans ultimately have their cars taken.   -Rent-a-Bank Schemes   You may have heard that some states have laws governing what interest rates lenders can charge. For example, in Massachusetts, even pay-day loans are capped at 26% APR. However, pay-day lenders can still charge triple-digit APR’s. They can do so from a scheme that popped up in the 1990’s. A rent-a-bank scheme is one in which a lender wanting to charge really high interest rates offers the loan through a national bank. Because national banks operate in most states, the state laws have a provision making them immune to the interest rate caps. This practice is very common for retailers who offer “buy now, pay later’’ items. For example, a furniture store may let you take a $600 couch home now in exchange for you taking out a $600 at a really high interest rate. However, you don’t take the loan out with the furniture store; it is through a bank. The furniture store makes a deal with the bank to operate this high-interest loan in exchange for some of the interest profit. The store would not be able to do this without the bank because of state laws, but the bank is immune to those laws.  In 2025, rent-a-bank schemes are mostly online, given the ease to launder money. In general, try to avoid taking out loans through retailers. Even if they are not doing the rent-a-bank scheme, interest rates will be much higher anyway.    How to Detect a Predatory Loan  There are a number of common things to be aware of that may signal that something is a predatory loan.  -Really high interest rates. Most predatory loans have much higher interest rates than the current going rates. It is always good to quickly research what average interest rates are for whatever kind of loan you’re considering. If the rate you’re offered is much higher than average, you should probably stay away.  -Advertisements targeting vulnerable populations. If a financial offer seems to be for a traditionally-targeted population, it may very well be predatory. Common vulnerable populations include people in poverty, people with bad credit, the elderly, teens and young adults, people of color, and immigrants. If a financial product seems to be directed (either directly or subliminally) at one or more of these populations, there may be predatory tactics involved.  -High fees. Predatory loans often come with a long list of high fees. Some common loans do have fees, which is simply part of the market, but predatory loans will have higher-than-average amounts or mysterious fees. (I once visited a car seller that had a “9-11 fee of $75 and a “manager’s fee of $250 hidden in the contract.) Make sure to research what current, reasonable fees are for loans, make sure to read about fees in a contract, and ask what fees are part of a loan.  -Aggressive sales tactics. Retailers that offer high-interest loans are often more aggressive with sales tactics. Salespeople, in general, can be aggressive due to commissions, but it can be worse in predatory places. In particular, you may be pressured to sign something. If you at all feel pressured to sign a contract, leave and take some time to research and think. As an example, my mother once was looking for a car. She found one she liked and talked about financials while her trade-in was being inspected. She didn’t like the high-interest offer and wanted to walk out, but they refused to give her her car back, threatening her with a lawsuit. She immediately called the police, which got the car salesman to give her car back.  -Low credit borrowing. In connection to targeting vulnerable populations, predatory lenders often do not show signs of caring whether you can repay or not. When you take out a mortgage or car loan, your ability to repay the loan will be scrutinized. If a lender promises you a loan “when others have said no,’’ that is a huge red flag.   "

  "body": " Debt Management   Good-bad-Debt  In Week 4, I gave you a rule: Never fall into debt! I also broke this by saying that some debt is okay. A better rule may be “Never take on bad debt.” However, this doesn’t have the same staying power as “never fall into debt!”  “Good debt’’ is debt you take out to better your financial position or adds value (even non-monetary) to your life. For example, a mortgage is used to buy a home. That loan allows you to live in a place that is your own, and your home will hopefully grow in value. A student loan allows you to get an education that will give you life satisfaction and access to higher-paying work. A home-equity loan can allow you to borrow cash you don’t have to make improvements to your home that can increase its value.  “Bad debt’’ is debt that you don’t use as a tool to better yourself. For example, borrowing money to buy a Playstation 5 would be considered bad debt. Taking a pay-day loan would be considered bad debt.  Some debt is tricky to classify. What about a car loan? A car is useful, but it loses money over time relatively quickly. It depends on a number of factors like where you live and work, family structure, what kind of car, how well you care for it, etc. What about taking out a loan to buy a pure-bred goldendoodle? For a pet, that would be bad debt. However, if that is to help start your own goldendoodle-breeding business, it may be good debt.    How Debt Happens  This section will look at some common reasons people fall into (too much) debt.  -Medical bills. Health is taken for granted by many people in the US until they don’t have it. Tens of millions of people are very under-insured or uninsured, meaning that if they have a large medical issue, they will be stuck paying the full medical bill or a high deductible. Medical debt is one of the biggest reasons people fall into debt. Fortunately, there are some laws in place that help lessen the pressure of medical debt, such as the one-year grace period before medical debt can be reported to credit agencies.  -Overspending. Simplifying spending too much money for their budget is one of the most common reasons someone falls into debt. In particular, over-using credit cards makes it very simple for someone to become buried in high-interest debt.  -Falling into a predatory loan. Predatory loans are generally advertised as a quick-way-out or a get-now-pay-later mechanism, but come with fairly-hidden high interest rates and hefty fees. Once starting on one of the loans, it can be difficult to get free.  -Student loans. Many colleges promise high returns on investments for education. While often true, starting salaries right out of college are often not high enough to fund a large amount of student loans. Many post-graduates find themselves struggling to keep up with their student loan payments.  -Gambling. Gambling is addictive. The high of small wins can sometimes numb the pain of big losses. Millions of American’s throw their money away to gambling and lotteries.  -Unemployment. In the event of losing a job, without a sufficient emergency fund, someone may need to turn to debt to keep up with living expenses.  -Divorce and separation. Legal fees, loss of secondary income, and child-support payments can make separation a costly process.    Do I Have a Debt Problem?  The first step in solving a problem you have is simply admitting (and recognizing) that you have a problem. Many people in unmanageable debt don’t realize or can’t accept that they are in dire straits. Here are common signs that you may have a debt problem.  -Missing payments. If you start missing payments on your bills, that is a huge sign that you are too burdened with debt.  -Ignoring bills or calls from debtors. If you find yourself throwing away bills without looking at them or ignoring calls from numbers you know are from your lenders, you may have a debt problem.  -Making minimum payments. If you find yourself only making minimum payments on your bills, it may be a sign that your finances are stretched too thin.  -Borrowing money to pay other debts. If you have to borrow money from one source to pay back a loan from another, you may have a debt problem.  -Regularly asking family and friends to lend you money. If you find yourself needing to ask someone else for money, you may have too much debt.  -Using credit cards as a means to borrow and not just for convenience. If you use a credit card to purchase everyday necessities like groceries or paying rent (and you’re doing it out of necessity, not just as a means of convenience), that is a sign you have a debt problem.  –Being worried about bills. If you find yourself stressing over how you will pay a bill, that is a sign that your debt is overburdening you.  Keep in mind that no one chooses to be overburdened by debt. It is not something that you should feel shame over. Most Americans have some debt throughout much of their adult lives. Everyone makes some financial mistakes at times. Don’t pretend you’re in a more stable position than you are; the sooner you identify any problems, the easier it is to correct.    Activity: Catch the Red Flags  Below are some sentences or thoughts that someone might say. For each, indicate why they are showing signs of having a problem with debt.     “Man, my credit card bill is due on the 6th. How am I going to come up with the payment?”    “Listen, I really appreciate that you helped with my groceries last month. Things haven’t gotten any better for me. Do you think you could help just one more time?”    “How did I rack up $12,000 on this credit card? These interest payments suck. This other bank is offering a card with 0\\% interest for 6 months and free balance transfers. That could take some pressure off if I put the $12,000 on that card. I might apply for it.”    “Get off my back! We’re doing fine. I’m paying exactly what the credit card banks tell me to pay each month, and we get by.”      "

  "body": " Getting Out of Debt  Before we dive into the actual methods people use to get out from debt, we need to really accept that the only way to healthily eliminate debt is to pay it off.   Reducing your debt requires you to make more money or to sacrifice other spending.   Also, it is impossible to reduce your debt if your budget isn’t balanced. If you are overspending each month, you won’t be able to pay down your debt. So, your first step should be adjusting your expenses or living situation so that you can at least break even each month. (See Weeks 2 and 3.)  For this section, we will present two methods for working off your debt. Both methods involve examining your debt and strategically paying bills.   High-Rate Method  The first method for paying off debt is the better one long-term. The philosophy is simple: pay the most expensive debt first. With the highest-rate method , you focus on paying your debt with the highest interest rate first. Now, always make sure you’re making at least the minimum payments on all your debt. However, you will focus any money you can into paying off your debt with the highest interest rate.  The logic behind this method is that debt with the highest interest will accumulate more money that you’ll need to pay back over time. Debt with lower interest will accumulate slower and can be left on the back burner for a bit. Once your highest-rate loan is repaid, move to the next highest.  Suppose you have the following debt:      Debt  Amount  APR    Credit Cards  $8,000  22%    Car Loan  $6,500  8%    Student Loan  $25,000  9%    Mortgage  $216,000  6%      Each month, you would make the minimum payments on all four loans. However, you would put extra money toward your credit card debt. Having this extra money to pay toward your credit cards requires you to adjust your spending habits (or make even larger life changes). You would continue paying only the minimum amount on the other three loans while paying the credit cards as much as possible until the full $8,000 has been paid. You would then move onto your student loans.  In the long-run, this method will save you the most money because you are preventing more interest from accumulating. However, if your high-interest loans are also large loans, you may not have the satisfaction of completely eliminating a source of debt quickly.    Snowball-Method  The snowball method is a method that is great for seeing progress more quickly. However, seeing progress more quickly actually comes at the expense of paying more in interest long-term. Under the snowball method, you pay your debt with the smallest amounts first. The philosophy behind the snowball method is to get a source of debt eliminated entirely as quickly as possible. This not only gives you a great deal of satisfaction early, it also eases the emotional burden more quickly. Again, the downside is that your higher-interest loans will accumulate more interest, and you’ll likely need to pay more in the long-run.  Consider the same setup as in the highest-rate method.    Table for tallying points in each money personality type    Debt  Amount  APR    Credit Cards  $8,000  22%    Car Loan  $6,500  8%    Student Loan  $25,000  9%    Mortgage  $216,000  6%      Under the snowball method, you would make the minimum payments on all your debt, but you would put extra money toward your car loan because it has the smallest balance. You would continue this each month until the car loan was paid off. You would then move onto your credit cards.  If you are wondering why anyone would use the snowball method if it costs more in the long-run; the answer is psychology. Long-term goals are hard to maintain without seeing your progress. Imagine trying to lose weight without access to a scale or driving a long distance with no GPS to say how long is left. The snowball method can help you stay on track by getting you to a real milestone (paying off one source of debt fully) more quickly.    Activity: Helping Someone Get Out of Debt  Consider the following scenario: Ishaq had always managed his finances prudently. He’s never missed a bill payment. He tries to be frugal. However, his job doesn’t offer great insurance and has a $10,000 deductible. While biking to work one day, he hit a patch of ice and crashed heavily. After his hospital visit, he was stuck with a $10,000 bill. He set up monthly payments with the hospital, but the payments are nearly $500 a month. He is having trouble keeping them up on top of his other debt. His debt is as follows:      Debt  Amount  APR    Medical Debt  $10,000  0%    Car Loan  $13,000  10%    Student Loan  $5,000  8%    Personal Loan  $6,000  13%      Taking into account what method might be best for Ishaq’s personality, make a detailed plan to help him start to pay off his debt.    Bankruptcy  When a person or business is unable to repay their debts, they may work with the courts to help them come up with a plan to repay the debt. This process is called filing for bankruptcy . Generally, when you file bankruptcy, would agree to a short-term method of repayment, and after that period, your remaining debt is forgiven.   Chapter 7   When you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you will agree to having your assets “liquidized,’’ meaning that your stuff is sold for money. The court will look at your income, who and what you owe, and all the stuff you own (assets). They will appoint a trustee to facilitate the sale of your “non-essential’’ assets, the proceeds of which go to pay off your debts.  Many things can be identified as assets to be sold. Each state has a minimum amount something must be worth to be considered an asset to be sold. (No state will make you sell a $5 oven mitt.) Secondary cars, jewelry, investments, collectibles, and other expensive items will certainly be sold. Items necessary for survival (basic appliances, primary transportation, basic furniture, etc.) will not be sold. (Sometimes primary vehicles can be sold if they are particularly-expensive cars.) Housing is tricky. Certainly secondary homes will be liquidated. If you do not owe money on your primary home, it won’t be liquidized. If you do owe money and have not fallen behind on mortgage payments and do not have much equity, your house may not be liquidized. However, if you are behind on your payments, the house will likely be given to your mortgage bank. Or if you have a great deal of equity in the house, you may be forced to sell it.  Once the liquidation process is over, your debts will be forgiven. Keep in mind that some debts cannot be forgiven. Student loans, tax debt, and child support payments cannot be forgiven.  If you find yourself in a position to need to declare bankruptcy, Chapter 7 is a good option if you do not have many assets or if your income is low. It essentially is a “clean slate.’’ There are income limits for filing Chapter 7 . Not having many assets means not having much that needs to be sold. A lower income will convince the court that a smaller amount of items needs to be sold.   Chapter 13   When you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the court will look at your income, expenses, and debt. The court will come up with a payment plan for you to follow for 3 to 5 years. This payment plan is generally less than what you would be paying on your debt. After this 3-to-5-year period, your remaining debt will be forgiven.   Chapter 13 is for people with regular incomes. Unlike Chapter 7 , you can keep your assets and property. However, there are limits to how much debt you can have for filing Chapter 13 . If you have too much debt, you will not be able to file.  Again, keep in mind that filing Chapter 13 will not eliminate student loans, tax debt, or child support payments.  The Good and Bad of Bankruptcy  Bankruptcy is a means of last resort to get out from burdening debt. If you have lower income and few non-essential assets, filing Chapter 7 can help you get a clean start in a short amount of time (usually about 6 months). If you have a regular income and some property, filing Chapter 13 can help you work through some of your debt in 3-5 years while keeping your belongings.  Keep in mind that declaring bankruptcy is seen as the ultimate sign of being unable to pay back on your loans. This means that it will greatly impact your credit rating. People who declare bankruptcy often find it impossible to get a loan for several years after declaring. Many people lose their homes during their debt crisis. While declaring bankruptcy may remove debt to allow you to pay for housing, you may find yourself unable to find a landlord willing to rent to you. Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years. Chapter 13 stays on your report for 7 years.  Bankruptcy should never be “Plan A’’ to get out from a loan. Bankruptcy is a situation in which it is necessary for a court to decide how much you can actually pay back. You then have a very large mark on your credit that will hinder your financial goals for a long time. Bankruptcy is a means of last resort. Yes, businesses have used money laundering techniques to get out of big bills through bankruptcy. If you’re savvy and unscrupulous enough to do that, you probably don’t need this course.

  "body": " Risk and Reward   Risk vs. Reward  Consider the following. You have the opportunity to play a game. It costs $100 to play. If you win, you will get $10,000. If you lose, you get nothing and lose your $100. Will you play the game?  Some of you may have said “no” right away. Some of you may have responded “yes” right away. For most, their answer will depend on information I haven’t given. In particular, the chance of winning will likely affect whether or not you’ll play the game.  Suppose I told you there is a 99%of winning the game. Given the large prize amount, many people would chose to play the game. Suppose I said there was a one in a million chance of winning. Many people would chose not to play the game. Notice an important observation. There is a risk of losing $100, and your willingness to risk that $100 depends on the chance on being rewarded with winnings.  Let’s flip things around a little bit. Suppose you have the same game that costs $100 to play. Also suppose that you know the chances of winning the game is 25%(one in four). If the amount you could win was $200, would you play? What if the amount you could win was $10,000? You are probably much more willing to play with the higher possible winnings amount. Again, based on the risk, you want a certain amount of potential reward for taking on that risk.  One of the most important concepts in finance is the notion of risk and reward. Risk refers to the possibility that you will lose some or all of the money you invest. Reward refers to the concept of potentially earning money for taking on risk. That is, the riskier an investment opportunity is, the higher the reward you would expect for taking on the risk. Conversely, the higher the reward for an investment, the more underlying risk will be involved. This concept is known as risk vs. reward .    Risk Tolerance  Every investment opportunity comes with a level of risk. However, how much risk someone is willing to take on varies greatly from person to person. Someone who is more inclined to take on riskier activities is called risk tolerant . Someone who is less inclined to take on riskier activities is called risk averse . Risk tolerance heavily tied to some of the common money biases. For example, people with higher loss aversion bias tend to be more risk averse.  In general, there is no “good” or “bad” level of risk tolerance, with the exception of extreme risk tolerance or aversion. Someone with extremely high levels of risk tolerance has a greater chance of taking big losses eventually. Someone with extremely low levels of risk tolerance will miss out on opportunities to accumulate wealth. However, the majority of people lie in between these two extremes.    Activity: Risk Tolerance Quiz  Below are some questions related to risk and reward. For each, select the answer that best matches how you think or would behave. At the end, you will be asked to write a brief reflection on your answers.     Suppose you are on a gameshow and could potentially win money. You have one of four choices. Which of the following would you choose?     Be guaranteed $1,000    Have a 50%chance of winning $2,000    Have a 10%of winning $10,000    Have a 5%chance of winning $20,000       You have for investment options. For each, there is a best-case scenario and a worse-case scenario. Which of the following options would you choose?     Best-case scenario: gain $500; worst-case scenario: lose $0    Best-case scenario: gain $1,000; worst-case scenario: lose $250    Best-case scenario: gain $5,000; worst-case scenario: lose $1,800    Best-case scenario: gain $10,000; worst-case scenario: lose $4,000       Suppose you were given $10,000 that you have decided to invest. Which of the following would you choose to do with the money?     Put the full amount into a bank account (very low risk, low earnings potential)    Put the full amount into government bonds (low risk, lower earnings potential)    Put half of the money into a bank account and half into relatively-safe mutual funds (some potential for loss, low-moderate earnings)    Put the full amount into mutual funds (moderate risk of loss, moderate earnings potential)    Put the full amount into a few different stocks (high risk of loss, high earnings potential)       You and your significant other have set your wedding date. As a couple, you’ve decided on a very large and extravagant wedding. However, three months before your wedding, you lose your job. In order to get your money back on deposits, if you want to cancel, you have to do so now. Which of the following would you do?     Cancel the wedding until you have a new job and are financially stable    Reschedule everything, changing nothing, for a date six months from now.    Still hold the wedding in three months but greatly reduce the number of people invited and planned events    Hold the wedding as planned, rationalizing that you’ll likely be able to find work soon       Suppose you have $10,000 invested in a stock. One day the value drops to $9,500 (a 5%loss). Which of the following do you do?     Sell the stock right away because it is showing signs of falling.    Do nothing because stocks usually rebound.    Invest more money in the stock, betting that the stock will rebound       Which of the following sounds like the most appealing investment portfolio?     100%low-risk, low-reward    60%low-risk, low-reward; 30%moderate risk, moderate-reward; 10%high-risk, high-reward    20%low-risk, low-reward; 60%moderate-risk, moderate-reward; 20%high-risk-high-reward    10%low-risk, low-reward; 30%moderate-risk, moderate-reward; 60%high-risk-high-reward       Suppose you are one from your retirement. Much of your retirement will be funded through your 401(k). Which of the following strategies sounds the most appealing?     Have investments mostly in low-risk, low-reward government bonds because you could not afford a big loss so close to retirement    Have investments mostly in moderate-risk, moderate-reward mutual funds with the rationale that it is likely the market will go up over the next year    Have investments mostly in a few stocks with the rationale that potentially earning even more for retirement outweighs the risk of losing some of your savings       How would a friend describe you?   A play-it-safe type of person    Willing to take risks in a few situations    A gambler    A thrill-seeker        It is very difficult to classify someone into a category or risk-tolerance level. Risk tolerance is a spectrum, and that spectrum also depends on various facets of like. A sky-diving instructor may be fairly risk-averse when it comes to money. Someone who is very risk averse when it comes to physical activities may be a thrill-seeker when it comes to money. So, instead of tallying up points to put you into a category, instead you should look at your answers and think about what they may say about your tendencies to money.  For each question, the answers go from most risk averse to most risk tolerant. That is, (a) is the most risk-averse option, and the later letters are more risk tolerant. Write a short paragraph reflecting on your answers and what they may indicated regarding your risk tolerance. Would your answers indicate that you are more risk tolerant or more risk averse? Why?

  "title": "Saving and Investing",
  "body": " Saving and Investing   Saving vs. Investing  Strictly speaking, savings would be money that you set aside to be used for later. Keeping money in a jar or under your bed would be a form of savings. Putting money into a savings account is also usually considered savings. Investing is slightly different. When you invest in something, you use your money to buy or hold rights to some “asset.” Common examples include stocks, bonds, real estate, option, etc. The hope is that the value of those assets will increase over time, and when you sell the asset, you will earn a decent profit.  To better understand the difference between savings and investments, we need to explore a few terms of financial tools (“instruments”).  Risk: As we’ve explored earlier, the risk of a financial instrument is the relative likelihood that you lose some or all of your money. Generally, savings are less risky than investments.  Return: The return on an investment is how much you earn or lose. Notice that return can be positive or negative. In general, financial instruments with higher risk should come with larger return opportunities. Generally, investments expect a higher return than savings. (Note that returns are not guaranteed!)  Liquidity: The liquidity of an asset is a measurement of how easy it is to sell the object for cash. Cash, of course, is very “liquid.” A large office building would be much less liquid. Because of the difficulty to sell them, more non-liquid investments tend to come with higher expected returns than liquid ones. Liquid objects can be either savings or investments. Non-liquid assets tend to be investments.    Savings Opportunities  Let’s consider a few common savings opportunities:     Savings Accounts - These are accounts in which you deposit your money. In a sense, you loan your money to the bank that they use for their primary business purposes. In return, you earn a small amount of interest each month. Savings accounts are considered low-risk, low-reward options. You generally can withdraw your money fairly easily, making them quite liquid.    Certificates of Deposit (CDs) - CD’s are essentially savings accounts with the added rule that once you deposit your money, you cannot withdraw it for a pre-specified amount of time (usually 6 months to 2 years). It is usually still possible to withdraw your money before the allowed date, but it comes with a reduction in your interest earnings. Because you take on more personal risk by guaranteeing the bank access to your money for a longer period of time, CDs come with higher interest rates than basic savings accounts. CDs are still considered low-risk, low-reward opportunities.    Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) - An HSA is account in which you can deposit money to use for medical expenses in the future. While HSAs generally earn interest, it is quite low. Their main benefit is that any money you deposit into HSA reduce your taxable income. (However, if you withdraw it for other reasons, you will incur a penalty.) These are low-risk, low-reward opportunities.       Inverstment Opportunities  Next, we’ll look at common investments:     Bonds - A bond is a loan you make to a business or government. If you hold a bond, you will be entitled to a pre-specified payment at some future date (called the “maturity date.”) When the payment date comes, the bond “matures.” Bonds can have a variety of payment dates from months into the future to decades. Usually, bonds with longer maturity dates will offer a greater return. Some bonds pay interest payments (called “coupons”). Depending on the business or government, the risk of a bond will differ. Agencies with a long history of repaying bonds are less risky and offer lower returns. Agencies with less of a proven history of repaying debts need to offer higher returns. While you technically cannot get your money from a bond before its maturity date, you can sell your rights to the bond on a financial market. Bonds can have a low-to-moderate amount of risk, depending on the agency and time frame (and a low-to-moderate return).    Stocks - A stock , loosely speaking, is a representation of partial ownership of a company. How much a stock is valued depends a number of things. Some stocks pay “dividends,” which is a small share of profits the company earned. The value of the company’s assets influence the stock’s price. There is also a most squishy concept in that the value of a stock can change due to how much others are willing to pay for a stock. Stock values can change greatly day-to-day. A fire in a company’s headquarters can tank a stock’s value. A positive end-of-year earnings report can make a stock’s price soar. So, there is a great deal of risk with buying and selling stocks. They are high-risk, high-reward assets.    Mutual Fund - In general, it is advised to invest in a bunch of different stocks rather than just one (“diversification”). The idea is that, even if one company that you’ve invested in loses a lot of value, the others you’ve invested in can help cushion that blow. Some financial institutions offer mutual funds that can help with this. When you invest in a mutual fund, you are contributing money to a large pool that is used to buy a large number of different stocks. Mutual funds can be for stocks in a particular sector (like technology or oil production) or can be for an entire market. Mutual funds will come with some kind of fee structure for the service provided in management of the mutual fund. An index fund is a type of mutual fund with a more passive approach to selecting stocks, but they come with lower fees. Mutual funds are considered moderate-risk, moderate reward assets.    Commodities and Options - A “commodity” is a tangible asset like gold, oil, or rice. You can theoretically buy and sell these commodities on a market. More realistically, investors purchase “options.” An option is a right to buy or sell a commodity to someone at a moment in time. Usually, the commodity isn’t actually traded, making options essentially a gamble based on how you predict a commodity’s value to change over time. You can also purchase options on stocks. Consider an example. Stock XYZ currently has a value of $100. You think the stock’s value will increase, but you do not want to buy the stock. You can purchase the option to buy the stock later at a particular price. (The option price will depend on a variety of factors.) Suppose you pay $10 for the option to buy the stock for $100 in a month. If in one month, the stock’s value is $150, you will essentially get $40. (A $150 stock for $100 minus the $10 option fee.) If the stock’s value instead drops to $50, you do not buy the stock, and you lose that $10. Options are considered high-risk, high-reward assets. They are recommended only for experience investors.    Currency exchanges - You can also invest in a different currency. The idea is that if you invest in a currency that grows in value relative to the American dollar, you can sell that currency for a profit. (Or a loss if it loses value.) Cryptocurrency is a digital form of currency. Because of the high fluctuations in cryptocurrency values, it is considered high-risk, high-reward.      "

  "title": "Rate of Return",
  "body": " Rate of Return   Introduction to Rate of Return  There are a few measures of how successful your savings and investment outcomes are. One basic one is the return on investment or ROI. Your ROI can be calculated as: If your ROI is positive, it means that your investment has increased by your ROI percentage since your original investment. If your ROI is negative, it means that your investment has decreased in value by your ROI percentage.  For example, suppose you invest $1,000. Sometime later, your investment is valued at $1,250. Then your ROI would be Your investment has grown by 25%.  The issue with ROI is that it measures only how one investment has grown over some unknown time period. It is then difficult to compare different ROI’s without setting some standards,  The gold standard for measuring how successful your savings and investment outcomes are is the rate of return . The rate of return is a measurement of how your investments have grown or decayed each year. For example, if your rate of return on your 401(k) were 8%, that means that, on average, your investments in your 401(k) have increased by 8%each year.  The issue with rate of return is that it is difficult to compute exactly by hand. There are some approximations for it, but the computations are still tedious. What is important is how to interpret the rate of return for an investment.  From a computational standpoint, you can, in a way, think of your rate of return as the “interest’’ you have earned by investing your money. It isn’t exactly interest because your investment values can increase or decrease each day, but long term one way to think of rate of return is a measurement of the “interest rate” you’ve earned per year, on average. Consider the following example:  Suppose that Katherine invests $1,000 in a project that guarantees a rate of return of 10%over the next five years. How much will her investment be worth after 5 years?  If we treat that rate of return like interest, we can use compounding to get the investment value after 5 years. After the first year, her investment would be worth After the second year, her investment would be worth . After three, it would be . After four, it would be . After five, it would be .  We can shortcut this idea. Suppose you invest and amount and that the rate of return is (as a decimal). Then after a period of years, the investment would be worth .  You can also go backward. Suppose that you can invest with a rate of return of and that you need to have an amount after years. Then the amount you would need to invest now is .  In general, rates of return are guaranteed for low-risk savings\/investments such as savings accounts, CDs, and bonds. However, for higher-risk investments, rates of return are rarely guaranteed. (Otherwise, they wouldn’t be risky.)    Activity: Calculate the Investments     Chris can invest $5,000 today. He is guaranteed a rate of return of 7%. How much would his investment be worth after 10 years?    Repeat the previous, but suppose the guaranteed rate of return is 9%.    Manuel has some money right now. He will be moving out of his parents’ house in two years. He figures that he needs about $4,000 to get started in an apartment in two years. If he can earn a rate of return of 5%, how much should he invest today?    Brad invested $1,500 three years ago. Unfortunately, his investment wasn’t a good one, and his rate of return was -2%. How much is his investment worth today?       What is a Good Rate of Return?  First, to discuss what a “good’’ rate of return for an investment is, we need to understand why people invest money. People risk their money with investments so that they will (hopefully) come away richer afterwards. Become wealthier means having more “buying power.’’ However, this does not simply mean more money.  Consider this - who had more buying power?: Someone with $1,000 in 1900 or someone with $2,000 today? Considering that a house in 1900 would have cost around $3,000-$5,000 and that $2,000 wouldn’t even get you a five minute shopping spree at Sephora, that $1,000 in 1900 had way more buying power. Why? Inflation.   Inflation is a natural byproduct of a money-based economy. Over time, the costs of goods and services increase. In response, wages and salaries need to increase. The effect of inflation is that the value of currency decreases over time. Inflation is often measured as an annual compound rate. Average inflation rates are thrown around. A common one to use in the United States is 3%. Of course, year to year, this can vary quite a bit.  Consider this example. Suppose that 10 years ago an item cost $100. Average inflation has been 3%. How much would the item cost today?  We can calculate this similar to how we found ending values for investments: .  The reason we need to consider inflation when comparing investment returns can be seen in the following example.  Suppose Regina would like to increase her wealth. She invests $1,000. After five years, her rate of return was 4%. However, inflation was 5%. Did Regina increase her wealth?  At the end of five years, Regina’s investment becomes However, an item that cost $1,000 would cost . So, she could no longer afford an item that she could afford five years prior. So, while Regina did earn money, she lost buying power. So, she actually lost wealth.  Here is what to take away from this exercise: If you earn a rate of return that is less than inflation, you are actually losing wealth. Of course, a small rate of return is better than no return at all.  So, what is a “good” rate of return for an investment? Hopefully, it is clear that a “good’’ rate of return is at least as large as normal inflation. However, you would also like to increase wealth on top of simply keeping up with inflation. There is no universally-accepted number that defines a “good’’ rate of return. However, many people say that 7%has historically been a solid rate of return that can be expected from fairly passive investments in financial markets. So, some people say that 7%of above are “good’’ rates of return.    Rule of 72  Because people don’t tend to like whipping out a calculator everytime they talk about investments, some people use the Rule of 72 to think about how investments will grow under a certain rate of return.  The Rule of 72 allows someone to approximate how long it will take an investment to double with a given rate of return. If is your investment rate of return as a percent, then the approximate time for an investment to double can be calculated as years. For example, if your rate of return for an investment were 7.2%, then it would take approximately years for your money to double.  10 years may sound like a long time for money to double. The thing is that returns compound. This means that if your money doubles after 7 years, that doubled amount doubles after the next 7 years. That quadrupled amount doubles after the next 7 years. And so on.  Consider the following example.  Suppose you inherit $10,000 from a relative today. You want to invest the money in a mutual fund that earns a rate of return so that your money doubles every ten years. How much would you have when you retire in 50 years?  In ten years, you would have $20,000. After 20, that $20,000 doubles to $40,000. After 30 years, that doubles to $80,000. After 40 years, that doubles to $160,000. After 50 years, that doubles to $320,000.  The Rule of 72 can help you compare rates of return in a different way. For example, suppose you compare rates of return of 5%and 10%. Using the Rule of 72, under a 5%rate of return, it would take years for your investments to double. Under a 10%rate of return, it would take years for your investments to double.   "

  "body": " Retirement   Why Retire?  To retire from work means to fully or partially leave the workforce. For most people, even those who love their jobs, there comes a point when your body can no longer handle the demands of a full-time job. Whether it is to focus on family, take time for more life experiences, or simply to stop working a demanding job, most people want to retire from work.    Saving for Retirement - the Whys  Imagine that you have been working the same job for 40 years and have been earning reliable paychecks of $6,000 per month to pay for your housing, taxes, food, utilities, etc. Imagine that you decide to retire and that your paychecks stop immediately. How do you pay for your expenses? How do you survive?  In the past, American culture used to center around homesteads in which multiple generations lived and worked. Parents would raise children who would work on or near these homesteads. When the children were grown and raising their own families, the parents could do less work around the homesteads as their bodies aged. As industry progressed, families moved further apart, meaning elderly parents are much less likely to be supported by their adult children once they are unable to work. From this, the concept of saving for retirement evolved.  We want to save for retirement so that we can afford a similar lifestyle to what we’re accustomed to while working. Saving for retirement means having realistic ideas of what your costs will be when you reach retirement age. Housing, medical care, food, taxes, entertainment, transportation, etc. There is a great deal you need to plan for. Unfortunately, not only do you lose your paychecks when you retire, many of your expenses increase. As your body ages, it will need more expensive medical care. As your house value increases, you’ll pay more in property taxes. Of course, there’s also inflation, making everything cost more.  What I am getting at is that retirement has a big price tag. This, combined with the power of how fast money can grow with investments, leads to the following mantra: “The best time to start saving for retirement is as soon as possible.”    Activity: When to Start Saving for Retirement  First, open up this calculator: https:\/\/www.calculator.net\/annuity-calculator.html . Now, consider the following scenario. Suppose you are 20 years old. You would like to retire when you turn 65 (45 years from now). Suppose all you can save is $10 per week (or $40 per month). Suppose that you can earn a typical 7%rate of return on your investments. Use the calculator to determine how much you could save up if you started saving:    Starting at age 40 (25 years of savings)    Starting at age 30 (35 years of savings)    Starting now (45 years of savings)    Set the “starting principal” and “annual addition” to 0. Set the “monthly addition” to 40. Set the option to “beginning of period” and set the rate to 7%. Only change the “after” setting.   Record your findings. What do your findings say about when you should start saving?     How Much Do I Need To Retire?  How much do you need to retire? That is a really, really hard question to answer. It highly depends on the lifestyle you want to live after retirement. Do you want to travel the world in five-star hotels? Then you’ll need quite the hefty sum. Do you want to live in a quiet one-room cabin in the woods? Then you’ll need much less. It also depends on unknown factors such as how long you’ll live, whether or not you’ll develop costly medical conditions, how inflation works out over time, tax policies, and so on.  As a really basic, overly-simplistic rule of thumb, I would recommend that you want to have about 10-13 years worth of your highest year’s salary saved up. This comes with a huge note. You don’t know what you’ll earn in your highest-salary year as that is usually your last year you will work. Here’s what you can do to help estimate how much you’ll want to have for retirement. Look up the average salary for someone with your preferred career in the area you want to live. For example, suppose you want to be a nurse in Boston; a rudimentary interest search says that the average salary for a nurse in Boston is about $100,000. Now, adjust that figure for inflation how many years into the future you will retire. Suppose that you will retire 40 years from now. Then that $100,000 figure becomes The number you get represents a very rough estimate of your salary when you reach retirement age. Finally, to get how much you need for retirement, multiply that by a factor of 10, 11, 12, or 13. So, on a low end, you’d want around to retire. On the high end, you’d want around to retire.  Please pay attention to the following:   If you are relatively young (teens, 20’s, 30’s), the process I outlined above is essentially useless!   It is useless because there is so much that is unpredictable. However, it can be a valuable exercise if you want to consider the scale of how much you need to retire. Yes, you will likely need to be a millionaire in order to retire. Keep in mind that while these numbers are quite high, your salaries will increase over time as well. It isn’t as daunting as it seems.  If you are starting to despair at some of these numbers, please move on to the next section for hope.    Activity: Saving for Retirement Isn't that Scary  Head back to the annuity calculator: https:\/\/www.calculator.net\/annuity-calculator.html   Suppose you are 25 years old and would like to start saving for retirement. Your job currently pays you $85,000 annually, which comes to $5,000 per month after taxes. You follow the 50-30-20 budgeting plan and put 20%of your take-home pay ($1,000) into savings. You put $750 into your retirement account each month and $250 into a general savings account.     Using the annuity calculator and using $0 as starting principal, $0 as the annual addition, $750 as the monthly addition, and 7%as the annual growth rate, determine how much you’ll have saved in your retirement account in ten years (age 35).    After ten years (age 35), you are making more money. You are able to put aside twice as much per month into your retirement account ($1,500 per month). Use your answer to part 1 as the starting principal amount. (The amount already saved up.) Determine how much you’ll have in your retirement account in another ten years (age 45).    After another ten years (age 45), you are making more money. You can now put aside $2,250 per month into your retirement account. Use your answer from part 2 as the starting principal amount. Determine how much you’ll have in your retirement account in another ten years (age 55).    After another ten years (age 55), you are making more money. You can now put aside $3,000 per month into your retirement account. Use your answer from part 3 as the starting principal amount. Determine how much you’ll have in your retirement account in another ten years (age 65).    If your goal is to have $3,000,000 saved up for retirement, could you retire at age 65?       Debrief: How Realistic is this Savings Plan?  Do a bit of research online. Look at average salaries for college graduates in Massachusetts. Imagine sharing a house with a partner who makes a similar income. Imagine sticking to a 50-30-20 plan. Remember that your pay will increase over your lifetime due to inflation and pay raises. If you consider all of these, the scenario above is quite realistic. However, it hinges on starting early.  On top of this, you will likely have other opportunities to have retirement income on top of what you save (e.g. Social Security, employer-sponsored plans, etc.) to supplement your retirement. So, if you were intimidated by the large numbers in the previous section, remember that retirement is very much possible due to the power of rates of return (exponential growth) and starting early.

  "title": "Social Security",
  "body": " Social Security  We will begin with the most common, and most messy, way to save for retirement - the United States Social Security Program.   What Social Security Is  We’ll first discuss what Social Security means to you practically for retirement. Most jobs in the United States are “covered” by Social Security. For covered jobs, there is a 12.4% tax on your earnings that funds the Social Security program. However, by Federal law, half is paid by employers. So, 6.2% of your earnings is taxed and is paid by you, and an equivalent amount is paid by your employer. There is a maximum amount that is taxed (currently up to $176,100).  If you work for at least what is equivalent to ten years in a covered job, you are then eligible to receive payments once you reach a certain age. These payments help fund living after you stop working. What constitutes “ten years” is a little confusing now. You need to earn 40 “credits,” and you can earn up to 4 credits per year. To earn a credit, you must earn $1,810 in a covered job in a year. If you make four times that ($7,240), you earn 4 credits that year.  The amount you get per month when you start to “collect” from Social Security depends on a number of factors. It depends on how much you earned in your most recent years of employment (and thus paid in taxes), when you start to collect, how much your spouse’s benefits are, etc. The biggest one people consider is the age to start collecting. The earliest you can start collecting is age 62, but this is considered “early.” Hence, there is a reduction in your monthly payments (forever). The “full” retirement age is now 67. If you hold off on collecting past that, your payments will increase as a bonus to a maximum of age 70.  Most retired people in the US depend on Social Security in order to survive. For most of you, it will be a system you are part of, pay into, and collect from. Some people are “exempt” from the Social Security system. People who work for state or municipal governments with public pension plans are usually not covered by social security. For example, Massachusetts teachers and police officers do not pay Social Security tax nor do they receive benefits (unless they work a second job that is covered).  If you are wondering how much you’ll get from Social Security, it isn’t much. The absolute maximum someone can get now (2025) is $5,108 per month. That is only if they retire after age 70 and earned at least $176,100 over the past 10 years. More realistically, the average Social Security payment last year was $1,900 per month.  Social Security is not just about supplying income to retired people, but that is the largest part of it by far.    What Social Security Isn't  Social Security is one of the most discussed topics for politicians, and there is a great deal of misunderstanding regarding the program.  One of the most common misunderstandings about it is that Social Security is not actually a retirement program. It’s an insurance program. In fact, it’s true name is “The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance.” It is an insurance for people who live “too long.” The original foundation of the program interpreted living “too long” as living past when your body is able to do work. Social Security was designed to help those who could not longer work survive a post-employment life. It may be depressing to think of Social Security that way, but remember that it was created at a time when the majority of retired people lived in poverty.  Another misconception is that Social Security is meant to keep retired people in the lifestyles they’re accustomed to. You may have noticed that the average Social Security payment of $1,900 is really low - not nearly enough to live a middle-class lifestyle. Remember, Social Security is meant to help those who have outlived their employment lives survive , not be comfortable. Realistically, paying only 6.2%of your income in taxes really isn’t enough to fund decades of post-work life. So, Social Security is not enough to fund your retirement, and it was never intended to be.   One major misconception is how Social Security actually funds the payments it makes. Many people believe that Social Security acts like a huge retirement account. That is, you make payments into the system, and the Government invests that money so that it grows and is there for you when you retire. This isn’t how Social Security works. Social Security is a “pay-as-you-go” system. That is, Social Security payments that are being made to day come directly from those paying the Social Security taxes now. So, you are currently funding the payments for retired folk today. When you start to collect from Social Security, your payments will be funded by those in the workforce.  One matter of constant debate is whether Social Security is a program someone is entitled to after working a certain number of years or whether it is a program to help someone live for a certain number of years past retirement. When the program was created, these were essentially the same. The retirement age of 62 was chosen as an approximate age when people could no longer work and an age that many did not even live to see. Thanks to advanced in medicine and living standards, people are able to work longer and live well past that age. However, the retirement age has only gone up to 67. The debate on whether this retirement age is practical or just is constantly debated. On one end, people who work until 67 have worked just as long and hard as those in previous generations. However, those people are expected to live in post-work living way beyond previous generations. It isn’t an easy debate to solve.    Is Social Security Going Away?  The short answer is I don’t know.  You may have heard about Social Security and solvency issues or “running out of money.” There is some truth to this. Social Security isn’t exactly going to “run out” of money. In 7-9 years, the number of retired individuals will be greater than what the workforce will be able to fund. So, if Social Security does not receive more revenue, Social Security payments will need to be reduced. There are a few stray politician who will say that Social Security needs to go away entirely (but keep the taxes).  One factor that complicates this is that Social Security was moved into the general Federal budget. This was done at a time when Social Security was well funded and moving it into the general budget made it look like the full budget was balanced. Being in the general budget makes some aspects of the revenue\/cost streams of Social Security harder to analyze.  There are essentially two ways to make Social Security “solvent” or able to pay for itself - either increase revenues or decrease costs.  Decreasing costs would be simple, but very unpopular. This can happen either by reducing payment amounts or raising the retirement age. Current rand future retirees don’t want their payments decreasing, and those looking toward retirement don’t want to have to work for longer.  There are a number of ways revenues could increase for Social Security.    The maximum taxable income could be raised. That is, those with very high incomes would pay more into Social Security (and get more in payments). This is uncommon with the wealthy as investing in markets is seen as a better use of their money over paying into Social Security. Since it’s unpopular with the wealthy, few politicians want to explore this option.    The tax percentage on wages could be increased. This has been done multiple times before. The original Social Security tax was 2%. It’s now 12.6%. Of course, tax increases are never popular.    Raise the retirement age. While also reducing costs, raising the retirement age encourages people to work longer. However, most people do not want to have to work longer before retirement.    Providing work visas to immigrant workers will increase the workforce. We have an aging workforce, meaning that there are too few young and middle-aged people working. Undocumented workers generally do not pay taxes as they are paid “under the table.” Including these workers into the main workforce would significantly boost revenues into Social Security. However, immigration is a big issue for many US citizens, and this option is very unpopular for some.    Increasing taxes on the very wealthy would provide more funding. Since Social Security is in the general budget, it can be funded via any revenues. The taxes on the wealthy (and only the the very wealthy) have dropped by more than half in the past 40 years. Increasing that tax rate for the very wealthy even a small amount could re-fund Social Security.    Transferring funding from another program\/department could increase revenues. Those opposed to increased taxes on the wealthy usually support decreasing funding in other areas of the government. Of course, decreasing funding in other areas means those programs\/benefits are less available.    The problem with funding Social Security is a difficult one. Somebody needs to pay for it, and no one wants to. The clock is ticking, and a decision is going to have to be made.   "

  "body": " 401(k)'s and 403(b)'s   Employer-Sponsored Retirement  Due to the societal shift away from family homesteads to areas of industry, there grew a demand for financial security after a life in the work force. In order to attract the best workers, employers began offering benefits that help their employees save for retirement.  There are essentially two flavors of employer-sponsored retirement plans.  A defined benefit plan is a plan in which the employer makes a guarantee to pay a well-defined amount to an employee after they retire. The most common form of a defined benefit plan is a pension in which an employer makes a promise to make regular (usually monthly) payments to a retired employee until their death or a certain amount of time after retirement. We’ll discuss these more in the next section.  Because defined benefit plans put the burden of funding retirement completely on the employer, many employers have shifted to a defined contribution plan for their employees. Under these plans, employers put a defined amount of money into an account on your behalf. When you retire, you have access to the funds in this account. The idea is that these funds are invested and will grow long-term into a sizeable amount.  There are benefits and drawbacks to each plan type. Form the worker’s viewpoint, defined benefit plans offer the best security as retirement is up to their employer. However, workers can feel “trapped” in their jobs as they will lose much of the benefits of their plan if they change careers. Defined contribution plans allow for more freedom in employment as retirement accounts are usually transferrable. Form an employer point of view, defined contribution plans are preferred as there are no long-term commitments that they must honor.  These days, most employer-sponsored plans are defined-contribution plans.    401(k)'s and 403(b)'s  Taxation is a little tricky with regards to savings. The philosophy is, if you put money aside to use way into the future, is it really income? Because of this question, most retirement plans come in the form of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.  In most ways, 401(k)’s and 403(b)’s are the same. The biggest difference is that for-profit companies generally sponsor 401(k) plans, and non-profit institutions generally offer 403(b) plans. These plans must be sponsored by an employer (you can’t just open your own).  Under one of these plans, you have the option of deducting some of your pay to be deposited into your personal plan account. Many employers will also contribute funds as a “matching,” up to a certain percentage of your income. For example, if your employer offers 5%matching, for every dollar you deduct into your account, up to 5%of your annual pay, your employer will also contribute a dollar. If you deduct more than 5%of your total pay, your employer will not contribute any more. For example, suppose you earn $100,000 and your employer matches 7%for your retirement plan. If you deduct 4%of your pay in a year ($4,000), your employer would match that, making your total amount put into your account $8,000. If you deduct 7%($7,000), your employer would match that, making your total amount put into the account $14,000. If you deduct 10%of your pay ($10,000), your employer would still only contribute 7%($7,000). So, the total deduction would be $17,000.   In general, employer matching is considered part of your total compensation. You should always try to maximize employer contributions. Otherwise, you are not making the most you could from your job.   Currently, the most you can contribute each year in a 401(k) or 403(b) is $23,500. If you’re over 50, you can contribute $31,000.    Taxation and Roth Accounts  There are two ways to enjoy the tax benefits of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan. It depends on whether your account is a “traditional” or a “Roth” account.  With a traditional retirement account, any contributions you make reduce your taxable income for the year. For example, suppose you make $100,000 (pre-tax) and contribute $10,000 to your 401(k). Then only $90,000 of your pay is taxed. The downside to this is that when you retire and begin withdrawing money from your 401(k), that money is then taxed as regular income. So, if your 401(k)\/403(b) is your main source of retirement income, you will need more saved up with a traditional account because of taxes you’ll pay when you withdraw money.  With a Roth retirement account, any contributions you make are made after you pay taxes on your pay. So, if you make $100,000 (pre-tax) and contribute $10,000 to your 401(k), you will still be taxed on your full $100,000. However, when you make withdrawals from your account when you retire, that income is completely untaxed. Generally, you need to save a bit less with Roth accounts because of the lack of taxation with withdrawals.  You often have a choice of a traditional or Roth account. The choice depends on a number of factors. People with higher incomes often select traditional accounts to reduce their tax burden each year. People who start a 401(k)\/403(b) later in life also tend toward traditional accounts as they will earn less in investment income. People who start accounts earlier in life often choose Roth accounts as they will earn more in investment income but can avoid taxes on it.   "

IRA’s are meant to act as methods to supplement retirement incomes.  Practically, IRA’s function a lot like employer-sponsored plans. You can contribute up to a certain amount (currently $7,000 per year). You can have either a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your taxation preferences.  One common misconception is that you cannot have both a 401(k) and an IRA. You absolutely can! And you should!  The main difference with an IRA and employer-sponsored accounts is when you see the tax benefits in a traditional account. In a traditional IRA, you still deposit money into an account after taxes are paid from your paycheck, making it feel like a Roth account. However, when you file taxes, you can then deduct the amount you contributed from your taxable income, which will increase your tax refund (or reduce your taxes owed).   "

  "body": " Pensions   The Beauty of Pensions  When employers first began offering retirement incentives to employees, most offered defined-benefit plans in the form of pensions. Under a pension, employees have a portion of their pay deducted from their checks over their entire career. The employers use these deductions to invest in various markets. When an employee retires, the employer is obligated to pay a pre-determined amount to the employee until their death.  Pensions come in all sorts of flavors. Some even come with guaranteed healthcare for life. Some will continue to make payments to surviving spouses after the employee’s death. How much an employee gets usually depends on how long they worked for the employer and how much they made.  Unfortunately, pensions are expensive. And due to huge increases in life expectancies, many pensions are under-funded and cannot fully live up to the promises made. Thus, pensions are becoming increasingly rare. Massachusetts still has a state-sponsored pension system. It is completely funded by state employees (non-state employees don’t pay a penny in funding it). It is decently well-funded. Currently, the pension offers a maximum payment amount equal to 80%of the average of your five highest-paid years of salary, which is one of the highest available in the world of pensions.  One thing to keep in mind with pensions is that all payments are taxable.  The biggest downside of pensions is that there is no account that can be transferred to another employer (unless it is in the same system, such as moving from one state job to another state job). In this sense, employees can become “trapped” in a job because they do not want to give up what they’ve put into a pension.    Vesting Generally, pension plans come with a “vesting period.” In order to be eligible for pension payments, workers have to work for a minimum number of years. Once they reach that minimum number, they are “vested” in the pension. Being vested means that you are legally entitled to pension payments, according to the underlying agreements. For example, in the Massachusetts state pension system, there is a vesting period of 10 years. Often, once you are vested, you can leave the job and still receive some kind of payment when you retire (usually much reduced). If you leave a job before you are vested, you will have whatever you contributed to the plan returned to you, and you will not be entitled to any pension payments when you retire.  "

  "body": " Risk  Have you ever been in a situation where you are inclined to say, “What are the chances of this?!” The funny thing about coincidences is that they aren’t are unlikely as you think. One of the most important, but misunderstood, aspects of life is the nature of randomness and probability. In this section, we’ll be considering why unlikely coincidences and events aren’t really “unlikely.”   The Birthday Problem  One common coincidence that people experience is running into someone with the same birthday. Let’s briefly exam how common or uncommon this is.  Suppose there are a number of people in a room. What is the probability that at least two people share a birthday?  Notice that this question is difference than, “what is the probability that someone has your birthday?” We are just asking if there are some people in the group that share a birthday. It turns our that this question is more easily answered by asking the opposite question. Instead we ask, “what is the probability that no one shares a birthday with anyone else?” The reason why is it is easier to examine this question mathematically.  We won’t go over the mathematics in full, but we’ll explore a bit. Let’s suppose that 3 people come into a room one-by-one. Let’s also suppose (for simplicity) that February 29th birthdays aren’t a thing and that birthdays are evenly distributed over a whole year. The first person walks into the room followed by the second. What is the probability that person number 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1? It is . Now the third person walks in. What is the probability that that person does not share a birthday with either person 1 or person 2? It would be . (Because there are 363 other days in the year that are not the birthdays of persons 1 or 2.)  Now here is the important bit. What is the probability that all three have different birthdays? We calculate it as a process. First, person 2 has a different birthday than person 1. Then, person 3 has a different birthday than person 2. The probability is calculated as the product of those two events: . So, it’s very likely that the three people have different birthdays.  Now what if we increase the number of people? If we add a fourth person, the probability that none of the four people share a birthday with someone else in the group is: . So, if there is a group of four people, there is a chance that at least two people share a birthday.  We can keep going:  5 people in a group: 2.71%chance of a shared birthday.  6 people in a group: 4.05%chance of a shared birthday.  7 people in a group: 5.62%chance of a shared birthday.  8 people in a group: 7.43%chance of a shared birthday.  Notice that the chances of a shared birthday is growing with the number of people. Also notice that the chance is growing faster and faster. This is the important observation.  Now, if you have 23 people in the group, if you do the math, you’ll get that there is a 50.73%chance that there is a shared birthday in a group. That means that when there are 23 people in a group, it is actually more likely that at least two people share a birthday than it is that everyone has different birthdays! (This does not means that it is more likely that someone has your birthday than not. It means that it is more likely that there are some people who share a birthday.) That mathematical fact is not obvious, bit it is important. If you were sitting in a class with at least 23 students, do you intuitively believe that it is likely that some people in the room share a birthday? Probably not, but it is true.    The Probability-that-Something-Happens  Here is the important takeaway from the birthday problem. It is indeed unlikely that when two people meet that they have the same birthday. However, when there is a group of people, there are a lot of “chances” for there to be a shared birthday. With each person, the likelihood that no one has a shared birthday gets smaller and smaller, making the likelihood of some shared birthday higher and higher.  Let’s consider another type of problem. Suppose the WSU SGA is holding an event in which there are three games to play. For each game, only 20%of people win. How likely is it that you win at least one of the games?  Again, it is mathematically easier to find the probability that you do not win any of the games. For each game, there is an 80%chance that you’ll lose. The probability that you lose all three would be or 51.2%. This means there is a 48.8%chance that you’ll win at least once. Were you expecting that probability to be that high?  What we are doing here is not looking at one event happening on its own. Instead, we are looking at all possible events at once and asking what is the likelihood that at least one of the possible things happen. Or rather, what is the likelihood that none of the events happen? Or even, what is the likelihood that no coincidences happen? The more possibilities for some coincidence to happen, the more likely that something will happen.    Why It Matters  Here is some good news. You probably will not die from heart disease. About 20.1%of Americans die from heart disease, which means 79.9%do not. You probably won’t die from cancer. About 19%of Americans will die from cancer. So, about 81%of Americans do not die from cancer. You probably won’t die from an unintentional injury like falling or getting in a car accident. About 7%of Americans die from accidents, which means 93%of Americans do not die from accidents. You probably won’t die from a stroke. About 5.3%of American die from a stroke, meaning 94.7%of Americans do not.  Here is the bad news. If we ask, what is the probability that you won’t die from heart disease, cancer, an accident, or a stroke, the probability because or 57%. This means there is a 43%chance that you will die from one of those causes, which is very high. To make matters worse, if you are wondering what the probability is of simply passing on in your sleep without disease or disfunction, it’s really, really small. (Please note that there are a lot of other factors that contribute to these proababilities. So, these figures likely do not apply exactly to you individually.)  Here is the point to take away. Individually, the likelihood of one particular thing happening may be small. However, the probability that at least one bad thing happening gets quite large.  It is all about risk exposure. Take today as an example. Today, it is very unlikely that you’ll experience something that will require you to get emergency medical care (poisoning, injury, disease, etc.) Tomorrow, it will be just as unlikely. But what about some day in the next year? The likelihood that you will need emergency medical care at some point in the next year is substantially higher than the likelihood that you will need it on one particular day.   "

  "body": " Insurance   What Is Insurance?  We’ve already examined one big insurance program: Social Security. We’ve never discussed what insurance actually is. Insurance is an agreement of sorts. Someone who is exposed to a certain risk of something bad happening may want the security of being able to survive or afford getting through that bad thing, should it happen. Suppose, for example, someone is concerned that their car may be stolen one day. They may want some kind of protection financially should their care actually get stolen. Insurance is a way for this security to happen.  A person or company may be willing the help someone get through a certain negative experience in exchange for money. That is, for example, perhaps some company is willing to reimburse the person if their car were actually stolen. The risk of a stolen car gets moved from the person to the company. The company would not take on this risk for free though. The person would need to pay the company compensation for taking on the risk. This is essentially how insurance works at its most basic.    How Insurance Works  When you are concerned about the possibility of a bad event (getting injured, your car gets damaged, your house burns down, etc.), you may want to protect yourself financially from these events. For example, maybe you want to protect yourself from needing to pay a medical bill or needing to fix your car or needing to rebuild your house. For many of these possible bad events, an insurance provider may be willing to take on your financial obligations should something bad occur in exchange for compensation. This financial compensation is usually through regular payments called premiums .  Let’s take a house as an example. Suppose that you own a house that would cost $300,000 to rebuild or replace. You likely don’t have that money and wouldn’t be able to take out another loan to rebuild your house, should something happen. You could protect yourself from that scenario by setting up an insurance policy with a provider. They may charge you something in the range of $500-$900 for a premium per month to take on the finances of rebuilding your home. That sounds like a lot of money to pay each month, but it depends on how much you value protection.  Once you have a policy in place, you are covered by your insurance provider in the event that a covered event happens. For example, more house insurance policy will cover damage from accidental fire, but they won’t cover fire damage if you purposely set your house on fire. When a covered event happens, you get in contact with your insurance company to file a claim . Over a bit of time, the insurance company will either give you a check for you to use to pay for bills and other expenses related to the event or pay the various service providers directly.  Theoretically, any “bad” event in life could be covered by some insurance policy. The big ones are medical issues, automobile issues, building issues, early death, and property loss. However, you can get insurance on things like weather delaying your plane flight, alien abductions, and someone not showing up to their wedding.  The important thing about insurance is that you need to have a policy with a provider before a bad event happens, never after. In some respects, insurance is a form of cost sharing. Multiple people pay premiums for their insurance coverage, and those premiums are used to pay for any covered losses or events that anyone in that pool experiences. However, to get the benefits of this cost sharing, you need to contribution your own premiums before something bad happens.    Mandatory Insurance  In some instances, whether or not you want to take on the risk of paying for a bad event, you may be required legally to carry certain insurance policies.  If you own a car in Massachusetts and want to legally drive it, you are required to carry a certain kind of insurance. If you are responsible for a car accident, you would be required to pay for repairing or replacing the other person’s car. You will also likely have some injury, and you would be responsible for paying for those medical expenses (up to a certain amount). You are required to carry insurance that would cover those expenses. This required insurance can make owning a car really expensive. The rationale for this requirement is that most people cannot pay for the expenses relating to an accident when they cause one. It is also expensive and difficult for the victim in the accident to get any sort of payment from the “at-fault” driver. While it may seem like this required insurance is an unnecessary expense that protects others, as a whole group, you are just as protected with every else’s insurance policies.  If you take out a loan to purchase something, often a house or car, the lending bank will almost certainly require you to carry insurance that will completely replace the thing should anything happen. So, if you want to take out a mortgage for a house, you’ll be required to carry insurance on the house. If you take out a loan for a car, you’ll need to carry additional insurance that will replace or repair your car should it get damaged or stolen. The purpose here is for lenders to protect the collateral on the loans. The items you buy with the loaned money serve has collateral for the loan. The bank wants to maintain that collateral. Again, it appears that this kind of insurance is something to benefit the banks and not you. Keep in mind that if this requirement were not part of loans, the loans themselves would be much more expensive each month.  The Affordable Care Act brings a requirement that every citizen have a certain level of “coverage” for medical expenses. The actual requirements are long and complicated, but just understand that every citizen is required to have some level of medial insurance. The penalty for not having adequate coverage is a tax penalty. However, it is easy to avoid this penalty by stating that you have a religious exemption to insurance coverage. One of the main rationales for this law is to make everyone part of the “cost sharing” in medical insurance. Again, it’s the situation in which if you only think of your medical issues in isolation or a vacuum, the requirement seems like a punishment, but if you consider the financial effects through cost sharing, you can see the benefit you get.

  "body": " Properties of Insurance  Unfortunately, insurance is rarely as easy as buy policy, have accident, get accident paid for. There are a number of different characteristics to policies that affect how money is exchanged. We’ll go over the most common ones.   Deductibles  If your insurance policy has a deducible , it means that the insurance provider will only pay for a bad event after you’ve paid a certain amount. For example, suppose you have a medical policy in which there is a $1,000 deductible applied each year. This means that before the medical insurance will pay for any of your medical expenses, you’ll need to pay $1,000 of your own money first. For example, suppose your medical insurance has a $1,000 deductible. Suppose that you get sick and need to visit your doctor, who charges $300 per visit. You would pay that $300. Now suppose that sometime later you fall and break your leg. The process of getting x-rays and a cast cost $4,000. You would pay the first $700 since that is the remaining balance on your deductible. insurance would cover the rest. All other expenses will be covered by insurance.  Keep in mind that in the above scenario, you wouldn’t like need to pay that first $300. Due to the Affordable Care Act, things like visits to a doctor can be held liable to deductibles. However, the idea outlined above is how deductibles work mathematically.  So, why do deductibles exist? The benefit to you are lower monthly premiums. Deductibles mean less risk for the insurance company, which means they’ll require less in premiums each month to take on the risks. It also has to do with the cost to process claims. Suppose you notice that your car has a really feint surface scratch on it that you could easily buff out for about $10. If you had an insurance policy for your car with no deductible, you could choose to take your car to an autobody shop to have the scratch repaired and have insurance pay for it. Not only would they need to pay the autobody shop (likely around $200), they also need to pay the employees who actually handle claims like this. It’s expensive. So, such an insurance policy would require much higher premiums compared to one with a deductible.  Deductibles aren’t mandatory. Many insurance companies have policies with no deductibles. You might be shocked at how much more expensive no-deductible policies are.    Co-pays  Co-pays are similar to deductibles. They are most commonly found in medical-related insurances. When you visit a medical office, you may have to pay a co-pay . This is a relatively-small amount that you pay for a medical visit, and your insurance would pay for the rest. For example, if your doctor charges $300 per visit and you have a $20 co-pay, when you visit your doctor, you would need to pay $20 to them directly, and your insurance would pay the remaining $280.  Co-pays are often the most common expenses people pay for medical care in the US. So, they are often viewed negatively. Much like deductibles, the purpose of co-pays is to reduce the monthly premiums people pay. Essentially, co-pays deter people from visiting a doctor for non-emergency situations. For example, if someone were to wake up with a minor sore throat, they may be inclined to visit the doctor to determine if it is strep throat or some other unlikely illness. However, a copay may make that person reconsider going until they have more pronounced symptoms. The benefit of this determent is that medical costs as a whole are much lower and alleviates the strain of having too few doctors. The potential issue with co-pays is that some people may not seek medical care when it is actually necessary.    Policy Limits  Some insurance policies have a maximum amount they will pay for a loss, injury, etc. This is called a policy limit . Policy limits are very common in car insurance and property insurance. Limits are not necessary, and the limit amount direct affects your monthly premium. The lower your policy limit, the lower your monthly premium. Suppose you insure your car that is worth $30,000 with a policy limit of $20,000. If your car is completely destroyed, your insurance would cover only $20,000. You’d pay the remaining $10,000.   "

  "body": " Health Insurance  Let's consider the most common forms of insurance in the US. We'll start with health\/medical insurance.   Single-Payor vs. Private  As you are probably aware, medical (health) insurance in the US is a bit messy. We have a much different system than most developed countries. Most developed countries have form of “single-payor” medical coverage. In such a system, most medical expenses are paid for by government funds, which is in turn funded through taxes. There are exceptions to what is paid for and what is not, but that is basics of a single-payor system. There are still medical insurance companies in these countries, who provided “supplementary” insurance on any medical care, supplies, or procedures that are not covered in the basic system.  The US does not have a single-payor system. We have a “private” system. In such a system, medical care is not guaranteed and citizens are responsible for paying for their own medical care. To help pay for medical expenses, people can get medical insurance to cover many of those expenses. There are certain forms of government-funded medical coverage. For example, Medicaid is a program in the US that provides basic medical bill coverage for certain people (pregnant women, low-income citizens, the elderly, people with disabilities). It is funded via Social Security and taxes. Most people have basic medical coverage via Medicare when they reach age 65. For most, Medicare is mandatory. Both Medicaid and Medicare cover very basic medical procedures, visits, prescriptions. Most people find they need to pay for “supplementary coverage” for many medical issues. Some states have their own medical programs. Massachusetts has Mass Health, which provides medical coverage for children, low-income individuals, etc.). It usually provides more medical coverage than Medicaid.    Employer-Sposored Health Insurance  Private medical insurance can be paid for individually or as a group. Many employers offer to pay for some or all of an employee’s medical insurance premiums as part of their compensation package. However, these employers usually pay for a group insurance, meaning that employees do not pick their own plan and go with what is offered through group insurance. Most commonly, employers will pay for 75-80%of insurance premiums. If you do not have subsidized insurance through your employer and do not have government-funded coverage, you would pay for medical insurance on your own. Generally, employer-sponsored medical insurance can cover the employee’s spouse and children as well (up until age 26) for an increased premium.    The Issue of Coverage  Medical insurance is expensive. Like, really expensive. Medical insurance premiums are about on par with what people pay for housing. The worst thing is that, as people age, the need for medical insurance drastically increases. Some people even delay retirement because they do not want to lose their subsidize medical insurance. There are a variety of factors that control medical insurance premiums, including rising costs of medical procedures, hospital and insurance company executive greed, people living longer, etc.  No matter the form of health insurance someone has, there is an issue of coverage. You medical insurance policy dictates what medical-related expenses are covered. Often, insurance plans will only cover the most financially-efficient option. For example, suppose you need a particular surgery. There is an older, more risky surgery that has been done for 50 years. There is also a newer, safer surgery that is more expensive. Based on a number of factors, your insurance may refuse to cover that newer, safer surgery if they deem the older one more financially prudent long-term. Particularly in countries with private medical insurance, people often worry about whether the medical care they need will be covered by their insurance plan or not. Sometimes, it is a huge surprise to people when they find out after receiving medical care that their care wasn’t covered by insurance and are stuck with a massive medical bill.    The Other Issue of Coverage  Here is one thing most people don’t know about medical bills. Medical bills can be negotiated. Insurance companies are very good at negotiating medical expenses. So, if you are given a copy of your medical bill, you may notice that the “amount billed” and “amount paid by insurance” are quite different. Generally, medical insurance companies have a maximum amount they will pay for certain medical procedures, supplies, prescriptions, etc. Medical provider may be willing to accept the negotiated amount. However, some providers will not accept the amount offered by insurance companies. In such a case, medical providers may refuse to “accept” your medical insurance, meaning that you cannot get medical care from that provider unless you pay for everything yourself, without insurance. Usually, medical providers will have a list of insurances they won’t accept or they will check prior to giving you medical care. So, it shouldn’t be a surprise that a provider doesn’t accept your insurance. This issue is particularly relevant for people on Medicare or Medicaid; many provider do not accept them.  You may see the term “in-network.” This essentially means that the medical provider has made a long-term agreement with your insurance company to accept the negotiated rates they pay. Some insurances only pay for “in-network” providers. Some will pay for “out-of-network” providers, but will make you pay higher co-pays.    Choosing Health Insurance  Whether you self-fund health insurance or get it through your employer, you are likely to have a choice in some of the details of your health insurance plan. In fact, some people choose employers based on what insurance they subsidize. Most people consider the following: premium amount, deductible amounts, co-pay amounts, and network area. Plans with higher deductibles and co-pays and smaller networks will have lower monthly premiums. Plans with lower deductibles and co-pays and larger networks will have higher deductibles. What is right for you varies.  Younger, healthier individuals often are okay taking the risk of plans with higher deductibles and co-pays, taking the position that they are less likely to need expensive medical coverage. Older, more fragile individuals often prefer lower-deductible plans as they are more likely to need more frequent or more intensive medical care. There is no right answer. It depends on your income, risk tolerance, and personal\/family health status.   "

  "body": " Life Insurance   The Basics  Life insurance is an insurance that pays money upon someone’s death. The idea is that when a particular person dies, it can create financial hardship on someone else. For example, when someone dies, it will likely put financial hardship on their spouse who now has to fund all bills themselves. Most commonly, people purchase life insurance on their own death with a family member as the beneficiary of the money paid by the insurance company.  Some employers offer subsidized life insurance for employees, which pays some number of years’ worth of their salary to the beneficially.    The Costs  Life insurance premiums vary wildly from person to person. Consider a 20-year-old person with a healthy lifestyle and a 90-year-old person who chain smokes and has chronic heart issues. One is more likely to die this year than the other. So, the premium for one will be higher than the other. Life insurance can be as cheap as $1 per month or up to thousands of dollars per month. There are a number of factors that contribute to life insurance costs. Your age, how much you want paid to your beneficiary, whether you smoke, your overall health, where you live, where you work, how far you commute to work, your hobbies, etc. There are some other demographics like gender, race, etc. that may or may not play a factor, depending on state law.    The Flavors of Health Insurance  The most common form of life insurance is term life insurance . Term life insurance is life insurance that you can have up to a certain age. If you die before that age, your beneficiary gets the agree money. If you reach that age without dying, your policy ends. Term life insurance is much cheaper than other whole-insurance options, which makes them more popular.  Whole life insurance is insurance with no age expiration. You are guaranteed coverages throughout your whole life. The downside of whole life insurance is that it is much more expensive. There is a common problem with the whole life insurance industry in that it can be predatory. Life insurance companies often target elderly people without life insurance with advertisements for whole life insurance, which is extremely expensive for the elderly. Commercials often center around scaring elderly folk into putting the cost of their death and funeral on loved ones.  Life insurance can even cover loss of quality of life. There are plans that will pay you if you experience certain life-limiting issues. There are plans that will pay for assisted-living care in old age, if certain health conditions are met. There are policies that have a savings element to them. The industry is very broad and complex. The ins and outs are way beyond the scope of this course. For now, just know the basic forms of life insurance.   "

In Massachusetts, your liability coverage will pay for your medical bills if you are in an accident. It will also cover the property damage to the other car if you cause an accident. (In “at-fault” states, liability will instead pay for the other driver’s medical expenses if you cause an accident.) In terms of medical expenses, liability coverage will only pay a certain amount (usually up to $8,000, but sometimes only $2,000). Your medical insurance would cover the rest. In terms of property damage to the other car, the amount they would cover is also capped. (In most states, the minimum cap is $25,000, but you can get more coverage.) You would be legally liable for any property damage over this cap (which is sometimes covered by your house insurance.)  Comprehensive insurance will cover your care for non-collision-related damage. Things like theft, scratches or dents from someone opening not being careful around your car, etc. This insurance is usually quite cheap, but it often has high deductibles ($500-$2,000).  Collision insurance will cover the cost of repairing or replacing your car if you cause an accident.  Generally, liability coverage is required by states in order to operate a car. This is definitely true in Massachusetts. Comprehensive and collision coverage are usually required by banks if you take out a loan for your car. If you no longer make payments to the bank, comprehensive and collision coverage are optional.    Totalling a Car  One nasty thing about auto insurance is the idea of “totaling.” Suppose you have an older car that is only worth $2,000 and you are in an accident. If it would cost more than $2,000 to repair your car, the insurance company will “total” your car. In this case, they would give you a $2,000 check and wish you the best of luck in finding a replacement car for that much. Totaling rarely works out in favor of the car owner, and many people need to seek legal advice when offered a check instead of a car repair.    Price Factors  How much you pay in monthly car insurance payments depends on a number of factors. You driving history, age, car model, where you live, how far you commute, your grades in high school, and whether you went to driving school are common factors. (The grades thing is generally for teen drivers only.) In some states, gender can be used as a factor as well.   "

  "body": " Other-Common-Insurances   Property and Renter's Insurance  Most people who one a home have insurance on the house. In fact, if you have a mortgage out on your house, you will be required to have housing insurance. At its most basic, home insurance will pay to repair or replace your house if anything were to happen to it. There are other components to it. Many plans will pay your legal expenses if someone where to get hurt on your property. Some plans will pay for anything you may owe in property damage you cause in a car accident. Most plans cover the cost to replace stolen or damaged items in you house. Home insurance can have a number of little tweaks to it.  One issue with house insurance is the cost. Most insurers will only provide “full coverage,” meaning that you can only take out policies that will fully replace or repair your house in case of any issues. Many people would prefer to have only partial coverage, meaning that only amounts up to a certain set amount would be covered. The reason for this preference is that most damage to a house costs less than the house’s value to repair. For example, if you have a $300,000 house and you set your kitchen on fire, you won’t need $300,000 to replace the kitchen. However, most house insurance plans make you have one that will repair or replace the full amount if needed, which increases the monthly premiums. The reason why is complicated and multifaceted. It has to do with cost sharing and “anti-selection.”  Renters insurance is like a lighter form of house insurance. Since you don’t own the building you rent, you do not need coverage to repair or replace the building. However, renters insurance can protect the belongings in your rented space or can even help pay to get you into a new place if something happens to the one you’re renting.    Disability and Long-Term Care Insurances  Sometimes, people become injured and cannot work for a while. You can carry disability insurance that will help replace your income if you become unable to do your job. Often, you can get disability insurance at a subsidized rate through your employer.  Because of the temptation (and frequency) for people to go on disability insurance (due to people essentially wanting a break from work or early retirement), there are a number of caveats to disability insurance. First, most plans only cover up to 50-70%of your take-home pay. This reduced amount is to encourage people to start working again when they recover. Most plans have a “waiting period,” which means there is a time frame (usually two weeks to three months) in which the insurance company will not make you payments until you’re beyond the waiting period. Waiting periods are meant to deter people from going on disability unless necessary. Many plans will only make payments for a certain amount of time after your injury (often three months to two years). This is again meant to encourage people to return to work when able.   Long-Term Care Insurance is like a long-term disability insurance. It is insurance that will either replace some of your income or pay for expenses when you are unable to work for longer periods of time. Long-term care coverage usually requires you to have more serious issues that limit your ability to function day-to-day such as not being able dress yourself or feed yourself. Long-term care can also cover living expenses in assisted living housing or nursing homes.   "

  "body": " Week 9 Homework     Suppose that you have two job opportunities. The first employer will hire you as a sub-contractor, meaning that they will not offer you any health insurance subsidization. The employer will pay you $35 per hour at 40 hours of work per week. The second employer will hire you as a full-time employee and offers health insurance subsidization. The employer will pay 75% of your health insurance costs. The employer pays $31 per hour at 40 hours of work per week. Suppose that health insurance premiums are about $1,000 per month.    Based on the above information and your own personal preferences, which employer would you choose to work for?    Explain your reasoning for your choice.      If you drive a car in Massachusetts, you need a certain amount of car insurance coverage. The minimum amount of insurance has these requirements:   Bodily injury liability. If you cause an accident, this will pay for medical bills of the other (victim) driver\/passengers. The minimum coverage will pay $20,000 per injured person and at least $40,000 per accident.    Proprty damage. If you cause an accident, this will pay for the other (victim) driver's car\/property. The minimum coverage is $5,000 per accident.    Personal injury protect (PIP). This will cover your own medical expenses in the case you cause an accident. The minimum coverage is $8,000 per accident. (If you have more than $8,000 in medical expenses, the remaining can be billed to your health insurance.)    Uninsured\/underinsured Motorist. If someone elses causes an accident and are not insured (or flee the scene), this will cover your expenses. The minimum coverage is $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident.     If you have the cheapest possible car insurance, you will only have coverage for these minimum expenses in the case of an accident. Some people recommend to pay more money on car insurance per month for more coverage with the reationale being that if your expenses exceed what coverage you have, you may need to pay for any expenses over those minimum coverages.    Do you think it would be wise (for you) to pay more each month on car insurance for above-minimally-required protection? (There is no one right answer here.)    Explain your reasoning.      In 49 out of 50 states in the US, car insurance is madatory, even if you own your car out right and don't owe money on it. (In New Hampshire, you don't have to have insurance, but you need to prove that you can financially fund any damage you cause.) Many drivers believe these laws are unfair, arguring that it should be each individual driver's right to decide if they want to protect themselves financially. Why do you think car insurance has been made mandatory? (The answer isn't insurance company greed.)    Find the following:   Suppose you have a comprehensive plan on your car insurance that has a deductible of $500. Suppose someone keys your car and it would cost $1,200 to fix. How much would your insurance pay for the repair?    Suppose your health insurance requires you to pay $20 co-pays for every doctor visit you have. You also have a $500 deductible. Your visit the doctor three times in a year. Each visit is $250. How much would you pay yourself, and how much would your insurance pay?    You have a car insurance policy with comprehensive coverage. The policy has a deductible of $1,000. It has a maximum payment amount of $5,000. Your car is pelted by golf-ball-sized hail, which causes dents all over. It would cost $7,500 to fix. How much will you need to pay for the repair yourself?       Many people do not elect to have insurances like life insurance, property insurance (if they don't have a mortgage), travel insurance, disability insurance, etc. They often rationalize that the likelihood of needing insurance is slim, and it is better financially to not pay the premiums for insurance. Write a few sentences that describes the pros and cons of this point of view.    In this week, we targeted two learning goals for the course - accessing wellness tools and social-emotional skills. Write a few sentences as to how this week’s material has helped you progress toward meeting these learning goals. The learning goal objective is as follows:     Accessing wellness tools: Students develop tools for improving their physical, social, and\/or mental\/emotional health and overall college experience.

  "title": "The Forms of Housing",
  "body": " The Forms of Housing  In this section, we’ll go over the most common forms of housing. You are likely aware of houses and apartments, but there are more options out there.   Single-Family Homes  What probably is the the center of most people’s “American dream” is a single-family home. A single-family home is what most people think of when we hear the term “house.” A single-family house is a singular building intended for one family unit. These houses are embedded in the property around them (can’t be easily moved). Single-family homes build to modern standards (“to code”) will have a kitchen with function appliances, at least one bathroom, a living space, and at least one bedroom separated from the living space.  Single-family homes come in a variety of shapes, styles, and purposes. Depending on a family’s preferences and needs, they may look at bungalows, cottages, ranches, split-levels, etc. as their home shape.  Single-family homes are great for families looking to have a solid structural building that offers at least a little distance from neighbors. They also generally provide private use of the property surrounding the building. However, since they take up more space than other types of properties, they are quite rare in city centers, meaning that they are not great options for people who do not like to commute into work.  While many people aim to live in a single-family home because of its comfort and privacy, there are downsides. Single-family homes are expensive. The sole owner of the house is responsible for all the necessary repairs and updates. Regular maintenance, such as lawn-mowing, gardening, painting, etc. is time-intensive and costly.    Multi-Family Homes  A multi-family home is a singular building that allows for two or more family units to reside in it without needing to share most of amenities. That is, it is a single building that can be “sectioned-off” where ever section has a kitchen, at least one bathroom, a living space, and at least one bedroom. Like a single-family home, a multi-family home will be embedded in the property surrounding it.  Multi-family homes are very common in New England, particularly in communities that used to be manufacturing centers. (e.g. Whip manufacturing in Westfield, paper milling in Holyoke, egg-carton production in Palmer.) They offer most of the same benefits as single-family homes. There also tend to be more multi-family homes in some city centers, allowing for easier transportation to work. One main downside is that the structure must be shared with at least one other family. Residents of a multi-family home will be separated only by a wall. Property usage must also be shared.  Multi-family homes can have a single owner or each sub-unit can be owned separately. In the case of multiple owners, the costs of structure and property repairs\/upkeep are split among the owners. This can cause some conflicts when it comes to agreeing on how to jointly make property decisions. Generally, it is cheaper to live in a multiple-family home as compared to a single-family home.    Apartments  Apartments are similar to multi-family homes in purpose. An apartment building is usually a very large structure that includes a large number of individual sub-units. (There could be as lows as two or up to hundreds.) Each sub-unit will allow for a family to live. In most modern apartments, each apartment unit will have kitchen amenities and a private bathroom. Some apartments do not have separate bedrooms (“studio” apartments), but most do. Often, there are multiple apartment buildings on one large parcel of land, which collectively are a “complex.” What appliances are available in an apartment varies greatly. Almost all will have ovens, but few have dishwashers or private laundry machines.  Apartments are generally cheaper housing options, on a per-month basis. Generally, residents do not own their individual units, which means the owner, rather than the residents, are responsible for most maintenance and upkeep. Given their inherent structural capacity to house a large number of families, apartments are very common in city centers, which can allow for easier transportation to work or other necessary amenities. They may even allow for life without needing a car. The downside of apartment living is the close-contact to neighbors and living space. Apartments can be too small for many families. It can also be difficult living with other families immediately beside, above, or below you, separated only by a wall. There may also be restrictions on what pets you can own.    Condominiums  Condominiums, or “condos,” are much like apartments, except that the residents are the owners of the individual sub-units. They come with the same benefits of apartments with the added benefit that ownership allows for stability in housing payments and security. They also come with all the same downsides as apartments with the added downside of “home-owners’ association” (HOA) fees. Because multiple people collectively own the large structure, each owner much “chip-in” for upkeep, repairs, and maintenance. This usually requires the condo owners to pay monthly fees into a pool of money to be used for such purposes. HOA fees can range from about $100 per month to hundreds per month.  Condos are good options for families looking to own their housing but have a smaller budget. Condos are also more common than single-family homes in larger cities. Condos may not be good options for larger families. Like apartments, the available amenities in condos can vary. Some may have laundry units, dishwashers, etc. Some may not. Also, HOA’s may limit what you can do to your unit. You may not be allowed to make major constructive changes. The HOA may also restrict things such as pet ownership, noise levels, etc.    Mobile Homes  Mobile homes are an interesting option. As the name implies, a mobile home is one that is meant to be somewhat mobile. (Not an R.V. though.) With minimal detachments, a mobile home can be lifted and transported elsewhere and re-hooked up to utilities.  Mobile homes are often owned by the occupants, similar to single-family homes. However, the land on which they sit are often owned by someone else and must be rented. Given their smaller size, usually larger parcels of land will house a large number of mobile homes. (“Trailer park.”) Each mobile home will sit on its own sub-parcel that the renter of said parcel will have private access to.  The main benefit of a mobile home is the cost. Compared to a single-family home, they are much cheaper to own. Mobile homes can come in a variety of shapes. Most are single-floor units, but they can function as studio-style places or can have a number of separate bedrooms. The downside of mobile homes include less privacy than single family homes (smaller land units), less structural soundness, and the fees to rent land. In particular, the cost to rent spaces in a “park” have been going up. Many parks are now charging $200-$600 per month. Also, mobile homes tend to be in more rural areas, making transportation more difficult.    A Note on Stigma  One issue with housing is the wide-spread idea of good\/bad. Many Americans interpret single-family houses as the “gold standard” of housing. Many people see apartment living as less-desirable living for inner-city populations and mobile homes as less-desirable living for rural populations. What you have to keep in mind is the historical context in which this arose and the influence of television and cinema. Historically, American families lived in homesteads, which had a variety of different shapes and functions. These were generally multi-generational homesteads housing three or four generations of families. There could be very large one-building homesteads, or homesteads with a few smaller single-family units. The main thing is that, for the majority of American history, single-family living wasn’t the gold standard.  From the 40’s to the 60’s, rich investors took on property development in which they bought large tracks of land, building housing, and sold that housing to families are apartment owners. This, coupled with the the rapid expansion of industry and transportation led many families to seek single-family houses and up-scale apartments. This movement became iconicized in media, representing such living as the only type represented. Think homes in shows such as “Leave It to Beaver” or “The Brady Bunch.” Or think up-scale apartments in shows such as “I Love Lucy.” Farms, trailer homes, condos, etc. were not really seen in media.  The important thing is that, what is most commonly seen is what Americans tend to consider as “solid, middle-class life.” However, there is much more diversity into what success looks like. If you find yourself looking down on the concept of apartment-living or a mobile home for no reason other than “it’s better” to live in a single-family home, you may be working under hefty society bias. Your housing choices should be influenced not just by finances, but also by your current life situation. Whether or not children are living with you, being able to physically get around the space, pet ownership, location and transportation needs. All these things should be considered when making a decision. There are many great reasons to choose an apartment over a single-family home for many families. Price, saved time on maintenance, close proximity to grocery stores and work, are all reasons anyone may prefer an apartment life, for example.  What I’m getting at is don’t measure your own success based on what your living space looks like.   "

  "title": "Owning vs. Renting",
  "body": " Owning vs. Renting  In American culture, we seem to prioritize owning a home over renting. Part of this is the cultural influence of media, as described above. Another component is simply based on our roots. Full first-class citizenship was originally only for male, white, adult land-owners. Not being any of these made you a second-class citizen. These days, land ownership is no longer required to participate in governance, but that residual idea of owning land being better still remains. However, if you can get past this society bias, then we can compared the practical components of owning your housing vs. renting. It turns out that there can be a number of different benefits to renting your housing.   The Pros of Owning  One major advantage of owning your housing is equity. Equity represents how much of your housing you actually own. Most Americans cannot afford housing with cash they have saved up and instead need to borrow money to purchase the home. However, when you do this, you don’t really truly “own” the housing. If you are unable to make the payments or need to sell the place for any reason, you have to pay back what you owe before you get the sale proceeds. For example, if you could sell your housing for $200,000 today (after realtor fees), but you still owe a bank $150,000 for it, you only have $50,000 in practical equity. As make your payments on your housing, your equity will increase, which increases your overall wealth.  Housing ownership usually comes with appreciation as well. Generally, housing values go up over time. If you buy housing and its value increases, your equity will increase even without you making payments. For example, let’s suppose that your house is worth $200,000 and you owe $150,000 on it. You have $50,000 in equity. If one month later the value goes up to $220,000, your equity is now $70,000.  Inheritance potential is another benefit of owning. If you own your housing, that can be passed on to future generations after you pass, potentially easing the burden of your children or grandchildren.  Beyond finances, there are other benefits of owning your housing. You generally have more flexibility in customizing your housing. For example, you generally cannot install the plumbing needed in a rented apartment, but you can in your owned single-family home. Flexibility depends on the actual housing. Multi-family homes or places with HOA’s may restrict what you can do.  Privacy may be another benefit. Generally, owned housing are not in large multi-unit buildings, meaning there are fewer other families in your immediate vicinity, which many people prefer.    The Pros of Renting  One of the biggest benefits of renting is monthly costs. Generally, it is cheaper to rent a space than it is to own that space, at least in terms of monthly payments. If you would like more of your budget to be used in other areas, renting may be a way to make that happen.  Flexibility is a big benefit of renting as well. If you need to sell housing that you own, it can take time and money. For example, if you sell a house that you own, there are some costs to that that you will be expected to pay (realtor fees, for example). With renting, it is generally much easier to move from one place to the next. For families with jobs that require frequent geographic shifts or who simply like changing locations, renting may be the best way to go.  Renters are generally not responsible for most maintenance and repairs. While they are responsible for cleanliness, renters usually don’t need to finance new appliances, broken windows (unless it’s their fault), or housing updates. Owners should be prepared to spent about 2%of a home’s value on repairs\/updates each year (on average). Renters do not need to worry about most of these expenses.   "

  "body": " The True Costs of Owning  In this section, we’ll go over what it costs to own your own housing. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume this is for a single-family home.   Mortgages  We’ve used the term “mortgage” many times so far, but we’ve never explored them. When you want to buy a house but do not have the full costs saved up, you need to take out a loan from a bank. The most common type of loan is a “mortgage.” A “mortgage” is simply a loan in which your house is used as collateral. So, if you are unable to keep up with your loan payments, the bank can take ownership of our house. If this happens, it is called “foreclosure.”  One thing about foreclosure is that it is costly for the banks. They generally cannot sell a foreclosed house for the full value of the home. So, banks generally will not loan out the entire value of a house. That is, if you want to buy a house that costs $200,000, a bank will generally not loan you $200,000; you’ll need to pay for some of the house immediately. The amount of cash that you pay for a house up front when you take out a mortgage is called the down payment. The amount of down payment needed depends on the bank and the type of housing\/state of the housing. It can also depend on the loan “type.” There are some government-subsidy programs that will allow you to have down payments as low as 3.5%of the house’s value. Often, banks require down payments of at least 5%. Some may require more. If you put less than 20%down, your bank may charge you “property mortgage insurance” or PMI. This is essentially insurance the bank gets that will help them recover the full value of your house in case of foreclosure. Once you have 20%in equity, you no longer have to pay for PMI.  So far, we’ve described “conventional loans.” These are loans for houses that are in good condition with nothing tricky going on. However, there are a number of other kinds of loans. For example, some people may want a “rehab loan.” With a rehab loan, you borrow money to purchase and fix up a run-down property. With these loans, you generally do borrow more than the (current) value of the house. The idea is that your property value (and equity) will rapidly rise after the rehab. There are a number of other non-conventional loans out there with different terms and purposes.  One of the biggest determines of your monthly mortgage payments is the interest rate charged. As we explored in our work with credit, interest rates are, in part, determined by your credit. Interest rates are also determined by geographic location, property condition, and rates set by the FED. It is important to pay attention to interest rates. A single percent difference can mean the difference between being able to afford a house or not.  There are generally two kinds of interest program available. The most common is a fixed interest rate. With a fixed interest rate, your interest rate cannot change, no matter what, over the life of your mortgage. You can technically “change” your interest rate by re-financing. However, re-financing is technically a whole new loan. There are also variable-rate loans .  Pay attention.  Generally, variable-rate loans are dangerous. Most variable-rate loans have a very low “come-on” rate. That rate is then allowed to be changed (almost always increased) after a certain number of years. Many families have lost their homes because of variable interest rates when their monthly payments suddenly increased by hundreds of dollars once the new rate kicked in. There are some scenarios when a variable interest rate makes sense, but you should generally only consider fixed interest rates.    Financing a Mortgage  One of the biggest barriers to home ownership is not the monthly payment but the up-front costs to taking out a mortgage.  We have gone over down payments, which already require a hefty amount of cash. There are other costs as well.  Taking out a loan requires closing costs. When you actually sign the paperwork for a mortgage and assume ownership of a house, you engage in a process called “closing.” These days, closing requires a number of institutions involved. Lawyers are involved to handle the contract drafting and signing. Title companies are involved for changing ownership of the house deed and maintaining the deed. Banks are needed to actually give the cash to the seller and real estate agents. Accountants may be involved for tax purposes. All this needs to paid for. With the exception of real estate agent fees, all costs for closing, called closing costs , must be paid for by the buyer. (Technically, since real estate agent fees are incorporated in the house’s price, the buyer also kind of pays for those too.)  While, technically, closing costs must be paid for up front, like a down payment, practically, they can be “rolled into” the loan. That is, you borrow those closing costs from the bank on top of what you borrow for the house. For example, suppose you want to buy a house that costs $200,000. The bank requires a 10%down payment, and there are $10,000 in closing costs. How much do you need to actually pay up front? You have two options. One is to pay the down payment and closing costs in cash. 10%of the house loan is $20,000. So, you would need a total of $30,000 up front. The other option is to roll the costs into the loan. This effectively makes the implied total house cost $210,000. 10%of this is $21,000, which is what you’d need to have in cash. The benefit of rolling in the closing costs is needing less cash up front. The issue is that you’ll be paying interest on the extra borrowed money.    Insurance  If you take out a mortgage, you will be required to have property insurance. Even if you don’t owe money on your house, you should have property insurance anyway. Insurance is another part of home ownership that is pricing people out of homes. The triple whammy of climate change, supply-chain disruptions from COVID, and the most recent tariffs put into place have made the cost of rebuilding a home much more expensive than it used to be. This has caused property insurance to sky rocket. This is worse in some areas. Areas with more hurricanes or wildfires are seeing astronomical insurance surges. Some insurance companies are dropping certain damage types from plans, which can drop the monthly costs, but it leaves your home in more danger. Also, some banks may not allow you to carry insurance without certain key damage types covered.  Property insurance can be hard to navigate. Many things influence your monthly rate. Also, the difference of one-tenth of a mile can drastically change the rate. Flood insurance is a main example. Some houses are in a “flood plane,” which often necessitates flood coverage in your property insurance. Other houses are often not required to have this coverage. Certain building structures may also influence your rate. Being surrounded by tall trees may increase the likelihood of damage from wind, which raises your rate. If you have a French drain installed, you are more protected from flooding, which may lower your rate.  While you have a mortgage on your house, your bank actually makes the insurance payments to the company. On top of your loan payment, you will also be charged the insurance premium in your monthly housing payment. Insurances costs vary wildly, but expect to pay hundreds each month for coverage. As the value of your house goes up and building material costs go up, your insurance payments will also go up.    Taxes  As owner of your home, you will be responsible for any property taxes. Your taxes are usually paid every six months. Much like insurance, your bank actually pays them while you have the mortgage out. The cost is spread out over months and are included in your total monthly payments to the bank. How much your tax payments are are determined by your home’s “assessed” value and the tax rate set by your city. Different cities have different rates. Generally, cities with more amenities and more publicly-funded things like parks and what not have higher tax rates. You should expect to pay a few to several hundred in taxes each month. Usually, your house’s value, which determines your monthly tax cost, is done every two years.    Utilities  It you own your home, you are responsible for utilities. While there are some programs in Massachusetts to help low-income families with utilities, most are responsible for the full amount. Water, heat, electricity, internet, etc. are all monthly costs. Utilities are usually more costly in the coldest and warmest months of the year. Depending on your house’s size and family size as well as location and utility companies, your average monthly cost can vary greatly. Expect at least a few hundred dollar each month.    Upkeep  Decay is a thing. Your house will get dirty. Things will break. Accidents happen. If you own your house, you need to pay for all upkeep. Mowing a lawn, cleaning a bathroom, tending a garden, replacing a broken stove. You have to pay for all of this. Generally, it’s recommended to expect to pay about 2%of your house’s value each year in repairs. General cleaning costs are not part of that.    Putting It All Together  There are a lot of costs to owning a home beyond what you owe your bank. Let’s take an example and break it down.  Suppose you want to buy a home in Westfield that is valued at $250,000. Closing costs are $10,000. The bank requires that 12%be put down. You take out a 30-year loan. The interest rate is 6.8%. The assessed value is $240,000, and the tax rate is 1.7%. Insurance costs are $2,000 per year. Utilities average $320 per month. You expect to pay $50 per month on cleaning supplies. How much would you expect to pay for housing on average?    If you roll the closing costs into the loan, you put down 12%of 260,000, which is $31,200. That means you borrow the remaining $228,800. Using a mortgage calculator, we find that the loan payments will be $1,491.60 each month.    1.7%of $240,000 is $4,080. So, the monthly tax payment is     The monthly insurance cost is .    Recall that you should expect about 3%of your house’s value each year. That would be That works out to $416.67 per month.    So, putting everything together, the cost of owning a house is .    Keep in mind that housing costs go up each year. Taxes and insurance go up with your home’s value. Utilities and other costs go up with inflation. So, always keep this in mind. Of course, there will be a point at which you pay off your house, which will means the loan part of your housing expenses goes away forever.   "

  "body": " The True Cost of Renting  In this section, we’ll look at all the expenses involved in renting housing. For comparison, we’ll look at renting a single-family house.   Rent  The biggest factor of living expenses is rent. Rent is what you pay directly to the property owner in exchange for living in\/on that property. Rent costs depend on a large number of factors. Housing size, location, amenities, what utilities are included with rent, landlord greed are just some of the things that dictate monthly rent. Essentially, the more it costs a property owner to own (offer the housing to you), the higher the rent will be for that property. So, even if you don’t pay the property taxes directly, they will affect the rent on a property.  In a sense, rent is simple and somewhat predictable. Generally, you can sign a lease with a landlord for 12-month periods, which dictate what your rent will be. After your 12-months are up, you can re-sign the lease but for a potentially-different rent. Keep in mind that rents do tend to go up year to year. Generally, rent increases are to reflect the effects of inflation and housing appreciation. Of course, sometimes landlords increase rents beyond this for higher profits.    The Problem of High Rent Increases  There are some great landlords, some horrible landlords, and everything in between. (The same is true about tenants.)  Keep in mind that some annual rent increases should be expected and are perfectly reasonable. If your rent increases by 3%in a year, that is essentially in line with inflation and shouldn’t be seen as some scummy business by your landlord. However, some landlords will try to raise rents way beyond what is reasonable. For example, during the COVID lockdown when the housing shortage was at its worst, it wasn’t uncommon to see rents increase by several hundred dollars year to year.  While landlords do have a right to raise rents (after a lease is up), renters do have a number of rights that they can utilize to help out.     If you feel that your rent has been increase way beyond what is reasonable, do not immediately start paying that increase rent and do not immediately sign a new lease under that higher rent. Even if you pay the higher rent once without signing anything, you have shown willingness and ability to pay that higher rent. You can’t be evicted immediately. Contact legal help quickly.    Continue to pay your original rent. If your landlord accepts the rent, even if they say you owe more, by taking the money they have shown willingness to accept that original amount as your rent. It also shows that you are not missing rent payments.    Take to your landlord and try to negotiate. Don’t take the first offer. Don’t take something that isn’t reasonable.    If you landlord decides they would prefer to try to evict you rather than take your original rent payments, they will likely try to do this through civic court. Once this happens, immediately call your local housing court and request to have the case settled there. This is extremely important. In Massachusetts, housing courts are far more likely to side with tenants, especially if they are showing they are paying rent.    Again, seek legal advice. You do not need to hire a full lawyer, but paying for one sessions with a lawyer for some advice could save you a lot of money.    It is illegal for your landlord to retaliate against you in any way for seeking your legal options. All of the above are legal. If you feel your landlord does something inappropriate because of them, you can sue for damages.       The Rule of 3  Generally, landlords want a bit of security regarding rent payments. Two common things happen with tenants. First, the last month a tenant is in a property can often be ignored in terms of rent. That is, if a tenant is leaving, they may choose not to pay the last month in rent, knowing that it is not cost effective for the landlord to try and sue over one single rent payment. Second, tenants often cause damage beyond normal wear and teat (putting a hole in the wall, breaking a window, etc.). To somewhat protect against these, landlords often require tenants to pay three months worth of rent immediately before moving in. This three-months worth of rent represents your first month or rent, your last month of rent, and an amount to be used as security.  Under this system, when you leave your rented space, you would not have to pay the last month of rent as you already had when you first moved in. (Even if your rent payments when you leave are higher than when you first moved in.)  The security is a “deposit.” This means that it should be returned to you after you move out, if there is no damage to the property beyond wear and tear. It is recommended that you take pictures of your rented space the day you move in as well as the day you move out. If your landlord (unfairly) tries to withhold your security deposit, you can sue through housing court for it back (plus damages). Keep in mind that it’s about fairness. If you got drunk and punched a hole through the wall, you’re responsible for it.    Utilities  Utilities are a big factor in rent. Some rents will include your utilities like electricity, gas, sewer, and water. Some rents include some of these. Some rents include none. When utilities are included in rents, your landlords are responsible for those utility payments, no matter how much you actually use. When utilities are not included, you are responsible for pay those utilities on top of your rent. Keep in mind that internet and cable are rarely included in rent.  It may sound like having utilities included is better. However, keep in mind that when utilities are included, that is factored into your rent payments. Your landlord will make predictions about your utility usage and factor that into what rent amount they charge. It is important to shop around. Try to predict what you may pay in utilities each month and determine what options give you the best deal. (Funny thing. Marijuana growers often rent places that include electricity in the rent. The grow lights take a huge amount of electricity, which the landlords have to pay for. I don’t recommend, since it’s illegal. But it’s funny. Unless you’re the landlord.)  In Massachusetts, landlords are legally required to provide access to hot water and heating. This does not mean that they pay for it. It means that they can never shut off those utilities for any reason. They must also work as quickly as possible to have those utilities fixed if anything needs repairs.    Other Costs  There may be other costs associated with renting.  Pets can be an issue. Some rented places allow most common pets, no questions asked and no fees. Some will allow small pets (cats, hamsters, small dogs). Some do not allow any pets. Some will let you have pets, but for an added fee each month. Common pet fees are $50-$100 per month per pet.  While you do not have to pay for repairs (that aren’t you fault), you do need to cover basic cleaning. You may need to clean more than you’d like to maintain the standard of cleanliness to avoid losing your security deposit. (If you don’t clean you shower and mold starts growing, you may need to pay for the remediation from your security deposit.) Generally, very minor repairs, like replacing a lightbulb, are paid for by tenants.  Laundry can be a huge expense. Rented single-family homes often have laundry machines. Most apartments do not. Some apartment complexes have coin-operated laundries in a separate building or basements, but these can be really, really expensive. Often, people choose to go to laundromats instead. Some apartment complexes will have laundry hook-ups in the spaces and will rent out machines on a per-month basis. No matter what, keep laundry prices in mind when you’re thinking about housing.  If you rent a single-family home, you will need to discuss whose responsibility it is to cover things like lawn mowing or snow shoveling. There is no law on these. Sometimes, they’re included in the rent, other times not.    Other Considerations  There are a number of other things to consider when thinking about renting a place.  Every rented property will have occupancy rules. Some of these are mandated by a state. For example, perhaps you and ten friends want to rent a two-bedroom place for a year so that you all have cheap housing, allowing you to save up money for your own down payments on houses. This wouldn’t be allowed by state law. (Unless the bedrooms were really large.) You will have to disclose how many people will be living with you when you apply to rent a place. Lying on this application can get you evicted. It’s a common practice among some tenants, trying to get around occupancy laws.  Applications may come with a fee. Usually, these are no more than $50-$100. Never pay any more than that for an application fee.  Some landlords will allow you to make remodels or renovations to properties. This is particularly true of rented single-family homes. You must always get permission before making any changes, but some landlords are flexible with how you set up your living space. Tenants often want to install gardens or laundry hookups. Keep in mind that you would be responsible for the full costs of such changes.   "

  "body": " Should You Rent or Buy?  Should you buy your own place, or should you rent? Before you yell out “buy” because of society bias, this question often requires more thought.   Personal Preferences  Keep in mind the time and money it takes to keep up a property. Do you have time to mow a lawn every week? Can you keep a rainy-day fund to pay for appliances that break? Do you want to paint your property’s rooms every so often? Whether you rent or own can dictate how much time you need to spend up keeping your property. Many people do not want to deal with upkeep and purposely rent spaces that allow for more time away from chores. Some people who are intent on buying their housing but do not want to handle upkeep personally choose to buy condos. On the other hand, many enjoy these kinds of chores and see them as a benefit of owning their housing.  Will your housing be the right place for you ten years from now? What about when your retired and having trouble getting around? A very common practice is for retirees to move away from their housing where they raised families and into smaller one-story units. Getting up and down stairs can be a real challenge in old age. Some also worry about what will happen after they die. Some choose to rent places to avoid the messiness of what will happen to their owned homes after they die. Keep in mind that it can take time to buy and sell property. You want to think about where you and your family will be in the coming years and have a space that is good for you and allows for needed flexibility.  Access to amenities is crucial. Housing closer to city centers is more expensive than in rural areas. This makes apartment-living the more likely option if you want to live in a downtown area of a bustling city.   "

  "body": " Week 10 Homework     For this first problem, you will go through the process of estimating housing costs. For this problem, you will pretend that you are looking to buy a condominium in Springfield, Massachusetts.    First, use a website like realtor.com or zillow.com to do a search for condominium for sale in Springfield, Massachusetts. What is a rough estimate for the average condo price that you're finding?    Next, we'll assume that you'll need a loan to buy a condo. Do a quick internet search to determine what the current average interest rate is for a 30-year mortgage. What is the current average interest rate?    Next, you'll determine how much you'll actually borrow. Suppose that the bank you choose requires a down payment of 10%. Also, suppose that the closing costs for the loan are $6,500. Using your condo price from part (a), determine how much you'll actually need to borrow from the bank. You can assume you'll roll the closing costs into the loan.    We now need to determine the monthly payment to the bank. Use this calculator: https:\/\/www.calculator.net\/loan-calculator.html . Use the top calculator. For the loan amount, put the amount that you need to borrow (not the house price). For the interest rate, use the interest rate you found in part (b). Have the term be 30 years. Keep the other options as it. Use the calculator to find your loan payment amount.    Now we'll look at taxes. Do a quick internet search to find the property tax rate in Springfield, Massachusetts. Assume the condo cost is also its assessed value. Use the tax rate you found to determine how much you'll pay in taxes each year. Divide by 12 to find the monthly tax payment.    Condos all come with HOA fees. Go back to whichever realtor site you used. In the listings you looked at, there should be information on the monthly HOA fees. What sees to be a rough average cost for HOA fees?    Now upkeep. For condos, some upkeep is paid through your HOA fees. However, some things you'll need to pay for yourself. A rule of thumb for a condo is that you can assume you'll need about 1% of the condo's value for upkeep each year. Using the condo value you found in part (a), determine the annual upkeep cost. Divide by 12 to find the monthly cost.    For the final step, we'll put everything together. Assume that insurance for the condo will be $90 per month. Assume that utilities will be on average $250 per month. Assume that you'll need about $60 per month in general cleaning and other supplies. Using your monthly costs from earlier parts and these other costs, determine the full monthly cost for owning a condo.      Please write a paragraph describing your current ideas for achieving your housing goals. Being realistic about salary, savings, and other finances, come up with a rough plan for achieving your housing goal. That is, make a STAR goal and give a brief description of how you'll achieve it.    Write a couple of sentences describing how your are feeling about the idea of housing. What are you currently feeling and why? If you have any questions about housing, you can also ask them here.    In this week, we targeted three learning goals for the course - metacognitive reflection and application, accessing wellness tools, and social-emotional skills. Write a few sentences as to how this week’s material has helped you progress toward meeting these learning goals. The learning goal objective is as follows:     Accessing wellness tools: Students develop tools for improving their physical, social, and\/or mental\/emotional health and overall college experience.

  "body": " Common Scams  Scams and fraudulent behavior are everywhere. It is important to develop a nose for sniffing out this things. Falling for a scam or fraud could end up costing you thousands.   Online Dating Scams  In the online dating scene, men are the primary targets. In this scenario, the scammer will create a fake dating profile and initiate conversation with you. What the scammer is after will affect the course of the conversation.  One common scam is to attempt to get you to move a conversation off the dating app. Generally, this is an attempt to get access to your personal information. Sometimes, the external site will ask for financial information like credit card and bank account numbers.  Sometimes, over a matter of hours, days, or weeks, you build a relationship with this fake person. The scammer will eventually ask for money or gift card information. The usual claim is that it is for travel to you or some kind of emergency. After sending photos of the gift card information, they will drain the funds.  Another common scam is simple blackmailing. Scammers may ask for revealing photos of you or inquire into very personal sexual interests. Some target people looking for a same-gender relationship but have no yet come out. Ultimately, once they the scammer knows your identity and has your photos or personal interests, they will demand money in exchange for their silence.  Cryptocurrency scams are also common. At some point in the conversation, the scammer will give you a “hot tip” about some kind of cryptocurrency and recommend you buy some. This is simply a mechanism to get your financial information.  Here are some tips for recognizing an online dating scam.     Is the profile too good to be true? Do they have a single picture of a person meeting every standard of western Hollywood beauty? Scammer will try to target your primal desires.    Is the personal being aggressive in starting a conversation and talking about feelings or sex? If a person very quickly develops eyes only for you, it is likely a scammer.    Is the personal a US citizen but for some reason out of the country for a little bit? This is a common ploy, often centered around needing money for supples or travel back to the US.    Does the person want to take the conversation off the dating app? In general, try to have a date in person before moving a conversation elsewhere. There’s no reason to use What’s App over the dating app conversation module.    Does the person want revealing photos of you? Yes, many legitimate people will also ask you for revealing photos. Don’t send them to anyone. Don’t demean yourself. You can find someone you is interested in all of you.    Does the person never seem to have the time or ability to meet? Do they cancel plans to meet? A scammer will almost never meet you in person.    Are there any conflicts in what they say? Scammers try to tailor conversation around manipulating you. They often forget something they made up earlier.    Does the person type using text that doesn’t feel natural? Scammers from other countries may make a number of poor word choices. Chat bots often use speech that is too formal.    Do they ask for money in any way? That’s not how dating works. A relationship should never be started with providing financial support. If you’re asked for money, run away.    Does the person want to know your social media information? This is often the start of someone looking to blackmail you.     Here are some tips to avoid online dating scams.     Be wary of profiles with a single photo. Scammers will either grab a photo of someone online or create one with AI. It is difficult to have multiple fake pictures of a single person.    Ask for a selfie. Good dating profiles show clear faces. It shouldn’t be a big deal to share other face pictures with each other. (Emphasis on “face.”)    Ask to meet. Scammers very rarely will meet.    Never send information or photos you would not send to a complete stranger. Until you’ve met the person in person a few times, always assume the person you’re chatting with is a complete stranger.    Don’t take conversations off the dating app until you’ve met the person.    Pay attention to what is said. Scammers may use chatbots what sound unnatural or too formal. They may also make numerous grammatical errors. They may also self-contradiction themselves.    Never click on any links that are sent. There may be promises of photos, more information, more erotic conversation, money, etc. Just don’t click on them.    Understand that healthy relationships take time to develop. If a person you’re chatting with quickly expresses strong emotional feelings, be wary. Relationships should never have a feeling of urgency.       Job Scams  A lot of people want a high-paying job that allows them to work from home. Be wary of any posted job that pays well and allows for a great deal of freedom. Ultimately, these scammers are after money from you or your financial information. They will usually have a weird way of paying you, such as money transfers or Paypal. They may ask you for money from you to set you up in their system as a new employee.  You should never have to pay someone to work for them. You may need to pay for uniform or other things with a legitimate employer, but those are deducted from paychecks. Never pay someone money to work for them.  Be wary of sending any personal information. A legitimate employer will need your personal information for tax and labor-laws purposes. However, you need to be sure the employer you’re speaking with is legitimate before sending anything.  Here are some tips to recognize a job scam:     Is the job too good to be true? Is it high-paying with very flexible hours with no experience needed? It is likely a scam.    Are they asking for any money up front? You should never have to pay money up front to work.    Do they want photos of you? Some scammers are after you face\/eyes as more financial accounts can be locked with biometric data.    Does the employer want to interview you via text? If you engage with this “interview,” you’ll be asked to click on links or provide personal information.    Did they contact you, saying they saw your profile and really think you’ll be a great fit for them?    Is there a sense of urgency? Are you being pressured to make a decision now? A good employer would never do that.    Will they hire you without an interview? Competitive jobs will always require an interview.    Are they using unprofessional tones? A reputable company with have a culture of professionalism. Typos, grammatical errors, and colloquial speech are red flags.     Here are some tips to avoid job scams.     Understand the concept of “too good to be true.” There are millions of people who want a high-paying, flexible job that can be done from home. These jobs will never just fall into your lap.    Research the employer. Is it a legitimate company? What are people saying on forums about it? Keep in mind that some scammers will create fake threads saying how great a company is. If other people are wary, you should be too.    Never send money.    Look for the job posting on the company’s website and not a job-posting site.    Pay attention to the speech used in messaging. It should be professional and grammatically correct.    Never click on links that start with http. You want https.     Job scams can be tough. There are a number of legitimate start-up virtual companies, particularly in the tech industry. Legitimate employers do need some personal information. You have to be very diligent. Never send personal information via a text, app chatting module, etc. Generally, it is safer to avoid virtual employers.    Phishing  “Phishing” refers to the idea of using texts, emails, etc. to begin a conversation with you with the intent of getting money or personal information from you.  Younger generations are a bit more cognizant of phishing because they’ve grown up with the concepts. Older generations have a harder time detecting phishing scams. Nevertheless, phishing evolves everyday and can become harder and harder to detect.  There are a vast number of ways phishing attempts occur. Most are through emails and text. However, they can come through the mail or the phone and various apps. Here some tips for recognizing phishing scams:     Is anything too good to be true? You didn’t win anything. You are not the long-lost heir to a fortune. No one needs a random US citizen to hide their fortunes.    Are they using a generic greeting? Apart from spear phishing, most phishing scammers won’t know who you are. So, they’ll begin messages without using your name. Watch out for things like “Hello Dear” or “Dear  Customer.    Is something wrong with your account? Are you being asked to click on a link to fix your account? These scammers try to scare you into thinking something is wrong, hoping you’ll click on the link. The link will either cause malware to be downloaded to your device, or the link will take you to a page where you’ll be asked for financial information. (Maybe both.)    Are you being asked to verify personal information? Businesses should ask you to confirm information.    Are you being notified that there is suspicious activity on your account? Never click on link based on “suspicious activities.”    Are you being offered money in any way? No one will every randomly contact you to give you money.    Are you being told you owe money that must be paid now? Scammers try to use a sense of urgency to get your money or personal information.    Are the email addresses involved from outside the supposed business? Is the business’ email address contain an error, like “amozon.com”?     Here are some tips to avoid falling for phishing attempts:     Understand that things that are too good to be true are, in fact, too good to be true.    Carefully look at the sender’s email address. Is it a generic domain like gmail? Is the company name misspelled?    Verify what is being communicated outside of the conversation. If your aunt texts you and needs gift cards, call your aunt. A scammer may be impersonating her number. If you boss needs your personal information, write a separate email to them, using the known address, asking if the message was legitimate.    Never click on links to verify information or fix a problem. Instead, log into your accounts as you normally would to see about any actual errors.    Never provide personal information or information about your employer.    Set your devices and accounts to update automatically. This way, nothing should every be in need of updating.    Nothing is that urgent. Your account won’t be permanently deleted. The police are not on their way. Your family member doesn’t need gift cards to not starve.       Service Scams  Some scammers will contact you, offering some kind of service for a low price. Most often, this is for home renovation or repair. They will ask for a large payment up front. They then either disappear with your money or do a terrible job.  Service scams can be tricky because of how payments work with legitimate contractors. Contractors do need money upfront to purchase materials and pay for workers. So, asking for money up front isn’t necessarily a red flag.  Here are some tips to recognize a service scam:     Is the price too good to be true? A good contractor will charge a large, but fair price.    Did they contact you out of the blue, offering a service? You should be the one contacting people to do work you need.    Are they offering a regular service, like lawn mowing, but they want you to pay a large amount up front? Services like these can be paid after the work is done on a regular basis.    Do other people know him? Ask for references.    Is there a contract with blanks in it? Some scammers try to get you to sign a contract with terms to be filled in later. You may find yourself trapped in a legal contract that is very unfavorable to you.    Is there a sense of urgency? Is the offer “now or never?”     Here are some tips to avoid service scams:     Recognize what is too good to be true. Research market costs for home services. Offers way below market costs are likely scams.    Ask to go with the contractor to purchase materials. Instead of giving money to them to get materials, you can can go with and pay for materials yourself.    Never sign a contract with missing information or terms you don’t understand.    Research the person. Ask for the names, numbers, and addresses of references.    You should be the one looking for a contractor. Contractors should not be contacting you out of the blue.    Get bids from other people. If it seems like most contracts charge more, the person who contacted you is likely a scammer.    Verify any claims made. Some people may offer to install energy-efficient devices that will save you money. Research those claims.    Be wary of financing offers. It is probably best to get a home equity loan from your bank instead of taking out a loan with the contractor.       Investment Scams  Investment scams have been around for as long as there have been financial markets. With an investment scam, someone will contact you, offering access to a very profitable investment opportunity or training to develop an unbeatable investment strategy. These scammers are usually after a large sum of money or your personal information.  Here are some tips to recognize an investment scam:     Is the offer too good to be true? Do they guarantee a very large return? Do they claim they have somehow come up with a proven strategy to beat the market? Remember, if there were a quick and easy way to make money in investing, we’d all do it.    Are they contacting you? Legitimate financial companies may advertise their business, but they generally don’t contact you individually.    Is anything “proven”? Financial markets have randomness to them. No one has a sure-fire way to get money quickly.    Is the investment strategy based on cryptocurrency? Run from these.    Is the investment strategy based on real estate? Run from these. If you want to invest in real estate, buy a property and rent it out. Don’t give people money to develop “world-class” property.    Is the investment strategy based on metals, like gold? Run from these. If you want to invest in metals, do it yourself.     Here are some tips for avoiding investment strategies:     Remember, things that are too good to be true are too good to be true.    Watch out for promises of quick and easy money. If such a thing existed, you’d be learning it in this class.    Watch out for investments in real estate, money, or cryptocurrency. You don’t need someone to invest in these. You can do it yourself.    Reputable financial experts don’t need to contact you with opportunities. If you’re looking for financial investment advice, research people and find one yourself.       Other Scams  Below are some other common scams to be aware of.      Charity Scams : Some people set up organizations posing as a legitimate charity. Some become wildly successful, like the Wounded Warrior Project. Before giving to a charity, research them online. Get opinions from people on Reddit. Research them on Guidestar.     Political Scams : Some people try to collect money to support a candidate or cause but run off with your money, If there is something in the political sphere you’d like to support, find that entity’s webpage and donate through there.     Online Shopping Scams : Many marketplaces are unregulated, such as Facebook marketplace or craigslist. It is best to steer clear of transactions through these marketplaces unless you can see the product in person before purchasing. Often, you will not receive the item you ordered, or it is of significantly-less quality than the ad suggested. Stick to market places that guarantee your satisfaction.

Yours,  HR Staff       Activity: Spot the Fake Dating Profiles  Below are two dating profiles. Determine which is\/are fake. Thoroughly explain all the red flags in the fake profile(s).     User: Amy_N_Westfield_Town      Newly-single and looking for whatever  Name: Amy  Age: 24  Locations: Westfield, MA  Bio: I tried the bar scene, but that didn’t work for me. So, now I’m trying the Bumpkin app.  Me: I work as a data scientist for research firm. It’s not very exciting, but the job lets me enjoy a nice house and plenty of free time for fun. Speaking of fun, I love traveling - European cities or white-sand beaches are my favourite. Would love a travel partner. When at home, I really love all things gaming. RPG’s are my first choice, but I can hold my own with FPS’s. I think my personality is hard to peg down. I can be anywhere from “mild” to “wild,” depending on scene. I don’t really have any plans for this app and who to meet up with. Right now, I’m cool with something casual. But who knows?...  You: I don’t really have strong preferences in terms of looks. You should be up for a good time, gaming, a lot of laughing. No self-identified “alpha-males.” Just be real.  Alright, guys! It’s your turn. Come at me with your best pick-up line. The cornier, the better!    (Yes, the photos are of me. Do not read anything into this. I just needed photos that I owned and didn't need permission to use. This is for instructional purposes only.)  User: LogicAndFinance247          Name: Jesse  Age: 38  Location: Westfield, MA  Bio: Relatively new to the Bumpkin app. Took some time to myself after my last LTR, but I’m ready to see who’s out there now.  I’ll give you the highlights, but I’d prefer to get to know each other over dinner.  I’m a math teacher by the day. Despite my profession, I’m really am a nice guy. By night, when I’m not grading, I spend my time trying out new hobbies. (Just got into soap making.) You can tell by my size that I’m a fan of food. I love to eat it, but I love to make it even more. (Lasagna and tiramisu are my specialties.) In my younger, richer days, I traveled as much as I could. Work doesn’t really allow me financially or time-wise to travel, but I’d love to find a travel partner.  In terms of dating, I try to have an open mind. Maybe someone around my age. An appreciation (or at least a tolerance) for immature humor is a must. I’m pretty quiet at first. So, you’ll need to be comfortable with a slow start. Relative financial stability on your end would also be a plus. Other than that, let’s not have any expectations.  I’m not really into “photo swapping.” So, please don’t ask.  If you want to check out my profiles on the socials, look for the same username.  Chat with you soon.                        "

  "title": "Identify Fraud",
  "body": " Identify Fraud   Identity fraud refers to the act of someone pretending to be someone else. The goal is for the fraud to use your identity for some kind of gain or to cause you damage. We’ll concentrate on using your identity for gain.   Information They Want  Identity thieves do not need that much information to steal your identity. Here are some pieces of you identity that thieves are often after:     Credit card information. With just your credit card number, an identity thief can purchase a great deal of stuff online. Some businesses require identity authentication, such as the card pin or your address. Some do not. Credit card information can be extracted from a hacked website. It can also be stolen physically in which the thief sees and records your card information.    Social Security number. With just your social security number, a thief can do a number of things. They could apply for a loan, direct your Social Security payments to them, etc.    Personal information often used for identity confirmation. Things like your mother’s maiden name, city of birth, pets’ names, street you grew up on. This information is used to hack into your various accounts.    Financial records. Your bank statements and other documents have a great deal of information on them that a thief could use to steal money or pretend to be you.    Medical insurance information.       How Your Information Is Stolen  Identity thieves has a number of ways to get your information.     They can get access to your wallet\/purse. Leaving anything containing your credit\/debit cards lying around is dangerous. Also, there are some people who work at places that accept credit cards who will write down your information. For example, a server at a restaurant could steal your card information after you give it to them as payment.    Identity thieves can dumpster dive for your bank or tax documents. These documents can have information like addresses, account numbers, your Social Security number, and other identifying info.    Some identity thief is done through hacked websites. The information collected can be from personal information, account information, passwords used, etc.    Some thieves can get access to information on your phone or computer when you connect to a public Wi–Fi. Passwords, personal information, etc. are often saved within your device.    Many thefts happen via phishing. Through phishing, you may provide your personal information to the thief. Phishing can also attempt to get you to click on a link that will install malware on your device, giving access to the thief.    Some thieves use “skimmers” at card scanners. If you use your card with one of these skimmers installed, all your card information becomes available to them.    Many people put far too much information in social media. Thieves can go through your social media looking for any information you post regarding where you’ve lived, where you went to school, family member names, preferences, etc. They may even use your photo for biometric locks.       How To Recognize Identity Theft  You often will not realize when your identity has been stolen for a long time. Here are some common warning signs:     You have charges on your card or receive a bill for something you didn’t order.    You receive a call from collections for something you did not buy.    Your credit report shows an account open that you didn’t open.    Mail is missing or stops coming to you.    You cannot access an account online because the password has been changed.       How to Prevent Identity Theft  There are a number of tactics to help avoid identity theft.     Put credit freezes on your accounts with all three credit bureaus. This prevents anyone taking out a loan with your information. Keep in mind that it also prevents you from getting a loan, so you have to remember to “thaw” your freezes before applying for anything.    Never let someone walk away with your credit card. Ask for a reader to be brought to you, or go with the person to the scanner.    Monitor your financial accounts frequently. If anything you don’t recognize pops up, contact the business\/bank immediately.    Put daily limits on your credit\/debit cards. This will maximize what can be taken out or used each day. This may not prevent identity theft, but it can reduce the effects greatly.    Be cautious of public WiFi. Make sure it is being offered from a legitimate source before connecting.    Do not answer calls, texts, emails, and social media messages from people\/numbers you do not recognize.    Never give out your Social Security number, birthdate, and other personal information unless it is for something you know is legitimate.    If you are going out of town, put a hold on your mail.    Shred all documents and card when you throw them out.    Use unique passwords for each website. Use longer ‘pass phrases” rather than shorter ones with lots of weird symbols. Do not write down your passwords.       What to Do When You're the Victim of Identify Theft     If someone uses your credit card, you should contact the card company and report the fraud. By law, they must reimburse you for fraudulent actions. Of course, you should request a new card with a new number.    If something comes up on your credit report that you don’t recognize, immediately call that credit bureau and dispute the change.    Contact your local police department. You can file a report. They can also advise you on next best steps to take    Place freezes on all your accounts. Put freezes on your credit reports and request new cards from your credit car companies.    Change passwords on all your sites. You should also consider opening a different email address.     Keep in mind that for some forms of identity theft, you may not be reimbursed for losses. Based on state laws, what options you have to recover lost money may be limited. It is vital that you mitigate the damage from identity theft as quickly as possible.    Activity: Protecting Yourself From Identity Theft  Below are some really common scenarios. For each, determine the best course of action. Briefly justify your actions.     You receive a call from a number you don’t recognize. You choose to ignore it. They leave a voicemail. Listening to it, the message is a man claiming he is from the IRS. He identifies you by name and your address. He says that the IRS has chosen to audit your most recent tax return and that you need to return his call immediately to address your return and to avoid fines and penalties.    You get a text from your Aunt. However, her texts sound strange and she asks if you could lend her money.    You have been chatting with someone on a dating app for two weeks. Their profile has only one photo, and they don’t have links to any other social media profiles. You think they are a real person, but you’re not sure.    You receive a letter in the mail. It contains a flier for a local contractor. He says he is new to the area and is looking to build a reputation and clientele. He says he will work for 25%less than any other contractor’s bids. You have been looking for someone to replace your countertops.      "

  "title": "How Taxes Work",
  "body": " How Taxes Work   Taxes funds collected (levied) by governments from its citizens and other entities. Funds collected from taxation fund many aspects of our daily lives. Taxes pay for work of some employees like teachers and police officer. Taxes pay for the construction and maintenance of roads. Taxes pay for parks, schools, and other public grounds. Taxes pay for some social services like Social Security or disability. Taxes pay for research and education, making your study at Westfield possible. Taxes pay for goods and services that you interact with everyday, whether or not you currently pay any taxes.   Kinds of Taxes  There are a lot of different kinds of taxes in the United States. We’ll go over some of the most common.      Payroll Taxes - These taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. These taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. Your employer and you split these taxes. If you work for yourself, you will need to pay these when you file your taxes. These programs provide retirement and health benefits (old-age insurance is more accurate) to the elderly and some health benefits to certain people. These taxes are levied by the Federal government.     Income Taxes - Income taxes are taxes you pay on many of your earnings over a year. Your paychecks, investment returns, small-business earnings, and other sources of income are taxed. These taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. If work for yourself, you pay these taxes when you file your taxes. The Federal government levies income taxes. Some stats also levy income taxes (like Massachusetts).     Property Taxes - If you own property, you will pay taxes on it. The amount you pay is based on the value of the property and the tax rate set by the local government. These taxes fund local goods and services like building schools, many aspects of public safety, construction of parks, etc. Local governments, like cities or counties levy property taxes.     Excise Taxes - These are taxes on particular goods. Some products, like alcohol, cigarettes, gas, etc. have excise taxes on them. These taxes sometimes have special purposes. (For example, gas excise taxes often fund road construction\/repair.) These taxes are levied by the Federal, state, and local governments.     Sales Taxes - Many products you buy are subject to these taxes. Sales tax is a fixed proportion of the sale price of a purchased good or service that is paid to a state and\/or government. Not all states have sales taxes. Many products are exempt from sales tax in some states. (For example, clothing and food from grocers are exempt from sales tax in Massachusetts.) Formally, the seller of an good or service pays the sales tax, but that cost is put on the buyer and charged to them at the time of the sale.     There are many other kinds of taxes in the US. There are inheritance taxes (taxes on inherited wealth beyond $1M, paid to state and Federal governments); occupancy taxes (takes paid on short-term lodging, paid to local governments); corporate taxes (taxes paid by corporations on profits they earn, paid to Federal and state governments); and tariffs (taxes paid on goods being imported or exported, paid to the Federal government); among others.    Where Do Our Taxes Go?  It is important for you to understand what your tax dollars do and don’t do. As you grow older and become more concerned with how your local, state, and Federal governments operate, you need to have a working knowledge of what your money actually does.  Here is a brief list of what kinds of governments do with your taxes.     Federal Government - Funds Social Security, Medicare, national defense, national parks, scientific research, Federal social programs, Federal government employees, environmental protection, grants to state governments.    State Government - Education oversight (especially higher education), transportation, state social programs, state parks, public safety oversight.    Local Government - Public schools, libraries, local parks, police and fire departments, public works.       How Much Do I Have to Pay in Taxes?  If you’re really rich, nothing.  But for most of us, the answer isn’t very simple. The answer depends on how much money you make, how you make your money, and what you spend your money on. There are even ways to reduce how much you pay in taxes.  Many taxes can be broken into one of three categories.  A proportional or flat tax is one that is based on a set percentage of some value. Most textbooks refer to sales tax as a proportional tax because a percentage is set in each state\/locality. If something costs $100 and the sales tax rate is 6%, then everyone who buys the item pays $6 in sales tax without exception. In a similar vein, property taxes are also considered a proportional tax.  A progressive tax is one in which the tax rate changes based on income or value so that a larger tax rate is applied to those with more income or things with more value. Income taxes at the Federal level are progressive. Those who make very little money have a low tax rate. Those who make a whole lot have a higher tax rate.  There can be regressive taxes. These would be the opposite of progressive taxes in that those with less income or things with lower value have a higher tax rate.  Many taxes are hard to classify in this regressive, proportional, progressive classification. Take payroll taxes, for example (Social Security and Medicare). It is proportional, kind of. For people who make less than $176,000, 6.2%of their income is taxed via payroll taxes. However, if you make more than $176,000, the remaining income isn’t taxed. Take someone who made $50,000 last year. 6.2%of their paycheck is taxed as payroll tax. Take someone who made $500,000 last year. Because only the first $176,000 is taxable via these payroll taxes, they pay only $10,912 in payroll taxes (or about 2.2%). So, are payroll taxes proportional or regressive?    Do Proportional Taxes Exist?  Some people claim that most taxes in the US are regressive. Take sales tax, for example. Suppose two people buy a television for $1,000. Suppose the first has a salary of $100,000 and the other has a salary of $200,000. Suppose the sales tax rate is 6%. The first would pay $60, or 0.06%of their salary on sales tax for that TV. The second would also pay $60, or 0.03%of their salary on sales tax for that TV. So, some people conclude that sales tax is actually regressive.   What do you think? Are taxes like sales taxes proportional or regressive?    Explain your answer with a few sentences    "

  "title": "Income Tax Filing",
  "body": " Income Tax Filing  If you earn income in a year, you’ll likely need to pay taxes on your income. When working for an employer, you’ll have taxes taken out of your paychecks. However, the amount taken out is an estimate of your actual tax burden . The exact amount you owe may not be clear until the end of the year. Very rarely do you pay the exact amount you need through your paycheck deductions. Most people overpay or underpay a bit. Through filing , you determine how much you should pay (or should have paid) in taxes. If you underpaid, you will owe the government more. If you overpaid, you are due a refund on the amount overpaid.   Terminology  There is a great deal of terminology you should know when talking about taxes.      Gross Income - Your gross income is the total amount of money you’ve made from all sources. Wages, tips, gifts, money you found on the street, interest, capital gains. Everything.     Adjusted Gross Income - In terms of taxes, your adjusted gross income, or AGI, is more important. From the government’s point of view, some of the money you earned isn’t really your income. Some expenses have certain tax privileges that reduce your income in the eyes of the IRS, which is a good thing. Your AGI is calculated as your gross income minus these special expenses. Some of these expenses are listed below:     Contributions to your traditional IRA    Interest paid on student loans    Educator expenses like books and equipment    Health savings account contributions    Alimony paid    Penalties paid on early withdrawals of savings (like withdrawing from a CD early)    Certain self-employment expenses        Taxable Income - Beyond your adjusted gross income, you can reduce your tax burden even more through exemptions and deductions. Your taxable income is the amount of your income that is actually taxed. It is calculated as your AGI minus the allowed amounts from exemptions and deductions.     Tax Bracket - Income tax is a progressive tax, meaning the more money you make, the higher your tax rate. The rate is not linear. There are a number of different ranges of income, and each has a corresponding tax rate. The income range your taxable income fall into is your tax bracket.     Exemptions - Formally, we no longer use the term “exemptions’’ in Federal income taxation; the terms were eliminated in 2018. However, the idea remains. When the term was used, an exemption was an acknowledgement that it costs more to support a family of five than it is to support a family of two. Having to provide for children or other people reduces your tax burden by lowering your taxable income. Today, you provide the same information, such as whether you are married, how many kids you support, etc., which still affects your tax burden. However, the “exemption’’ term is no longer used.     Deduction - A deduction is an expense that lowers your taxable income. Some expenses that are difficult for the IRS to predict have been deemed to be worthy of some tax benefits. There are a great number of things that qualify as deductions. Things like some medical expenses, charitable donations, interest paid on your mortgage, amounts paid in state or local taxes, traditional 401(k)\/403(b) contributions, gambling losses, and many more. The list also includes those that determine your AGI.     Standard Deduction - The IRS can’t really track all legitimate deductible expenses for every citizen. So, there is the “standard deduction.’’ The standard deduction is an option for tax payers in which they can claim that they have spent an “average’’ amount of money on deductible expenses. For 2024, the standard deduction was $14,600 for a single person (or married and filing separately) and $29,200 for a married couple. Claiming the standard deduction reduces your taxable income from your AGI by that amount. It is simple and easy. It works well for people who do not want to track their deductible expenses or for families who don’t actually have that much in deductible expenses. If you take the standard deduction, you cannot claim any other deductions. So, for people who have a lot of deductible expenses, they should not take the standard deductible.     Itemized Deduction - For people who do not take the standard deduction, they will need to list out all of their deductible expenses. When they do this, these are called “itemized deductions.’’ While a bit of a pain, this process is well worth it for people with large incomes or a large amount of deductible expenses.     Tax Credit - A tax credit works similar to a deduction. However, a credit reduces how much you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar. The difference may sound subtle, but it is hugely important. Suppose you have a gross income of $100,000 and that your tax rate on the amount was 25%flat. Suppose you had a $20,000, making your taxable income $80,000. Then you’d pay 25%of that in taxes, or $20,000. Now suppose instead you had a tax credit of the same amount of the deduction: $20,000. You would be taxed on the full $100,000 and would owe $25,000 in taxes. However, your tax credit of $20,000 would go against that tax owed. So, you’d only have to pay $5,000 in taxes. Tax credits are pretty awesome. There are a number of things that earn you tax credits. Some higher-education expenses, having children of certain ages, adopting a child, having lower incomes, self-employment tax write-offs, energy-efficiency credits, and many more are available.     Dependent - A dependent is someone you support financially. The most common example is children or stepchildren (up through age 19 or 24 for full-time students). However, there can be other dependents in the form of elderly parents, siblings, disabled family members, etc. The number of dependents you have affects your tax burden.     Refund - If you overpay in taxes over the year, the IRS owes you the amount you overpaid. A tax refund is this amount you overpaid and are owed by the IRS. If you owe on taxes from a previous year, any refund will automatically be used to pay those backtaxes.       Tax Brackets and Rates  The function of tax brackets is a little weird, but it is designed to be more fair. When I said that those who make more pay a higher tax rate, I was partially lying. Let’s take the two lowest tax brackets as examples. For 2024, the lowest tax bracket applies to those with taxable incomes between $0 and $11,600, which has a tax rate of 10%. The second lowest applies to those with taxable incomes between $11,601 and $47,150, which has a tax rate of 12%. Let’s take two people, one with taxable income of $10,000 and one with taxable income of $20,000. The idea is that it would be unfair for the one who has higher taxable income to pay a higher rate on the same amount than the one with the lower taxable income.  Here is the compromise. The first person pays the 10%on their taxable income, which would work out to be $1,000. The second person also pays only 10%on their taxable income for the first $11,600. The remaining $8,400 of their $20,000 taxable income would be taxed at the higher 12%rate. So, they’d owe     Activity: Determine How Much You Owe  Below are the tax brackets and tax rates for incomes in 2024.    Tax Brackets    Tax rate  Taxable income range    10%  $0 to $11,600    12%  $11,601 to $47,150    22%  $47,151 to $100,525    24%  $100,526 to $191,950    32%  $191,951 to $243,725    35%  $243,726 to $609,350    37%  $609,351 and up      For each of the following taxable incomes, determine the total amount of tax your would owe.

They would pay $12 on the amounts from $11,601 to $47,150. They would pay 22%on the remaining $850. (850 was calculated from .) The key here is that you apply the tax rate to the amount within each tax bracket. The first bracket has a span of . The second bracket has a span of So, the total amount of tax owed is .   "

  "title": "Tax Forms",
  "body": " Tax Forms  There are some tax forms that many of you have already seen, and most of you will see. We’ll cover some of the most common.   W4  The W4 form is a form you fill out for your employer when you are hired. This form helps them and the IRS estimate how much you’ll owe in taxes for the year and how much to take from your paychecks. In such a scenario, you don’t actually make payments to the government. Instead, your employer pays the government and reduces the amount in your paycheck.  The W4 will take your personal information. It will also ask for information that used to fall under “exemptions.” So, you will indicate whether you are married, how many dependents you have, etc.  There is one important box for married people or people with multiple jobs. There will be a line asking if you would like to have additional money taken out of your check for taxes. You may have the gut reaction of “hell no!” But hear me out. Suppose you and your spouse each made $35,000. When you fill out your W4, all they have to go on is your $35,000 salary. So, they will tax you based on that amount (tax bracket). However, with your spouse’s and our incomes combined, you bring in $70,000 together, which puts you into the next tax bracket. However, if both of you paid taxes individually under the assumption that you would be taxed at the lower bracket rate, you would be in for a huge rude awakening when you went to file your taxes at the end of the year. You would almost certainly owe a lot more than you were expecting. A similar thing can happen if you work multiple jobs. If you are married or have multiple jobs, it may be best for you to request extra money be taken out with each check.    I9  An I9 is simply a form your employer uses to verify that you’re able to work legally in the US. You’ll need to provide proof of citizenship, legal residency, and\/or work eligibility to your employer when they fill it out.    W2  If you work for an employer, you will get a W2. They are generally sent out each January. Your W2 is your summary sheet that you will use to file your taxes. It contains how much you earned in gross pay, how much you paid in taxes, how much you contributed to retirement accounts, how much you paid in health insurance premiums through your work, and a few other items.    W9  Subcontracting is becoming more and more common. You are a subcontractor if you perform work for someone, but you are not their employee. (Think of Uber drivers in most states.) Since they are not your employer, you do not fill out a W4 when you’re hired. However, they still must report how much they paid you (and thus your income) to the government. So, you fill out a W9, which gives them your personal identifying information for taxation purposes.    1099  If you get income from anywhere else, you can report it via a 1099 form. If you have interest income, money you made from selling homemade soap, or $100 you found in the gutter, you can report it on a 1099.  If you are asking yourself why you would self-report income that no one seems to know about that will only be taxed, keep in mind that it isn’t really that hard for the IRS to sniff out discrepancies. The last thing you want is to be audited. You’ll have to pay fines and late fees. If you purposely avoid disclosing a larger amount of income, you could go to jail for tax evasion.    1098  A 1098 form can help reduce the amount of taxes you owe. If you pay interest on student loans or a mortgage, you can reduce your taxable income via this form.   "

  "body": " Filing Taxes and the 1040 Form  We left out what might be the most important tax form - the 1040 form.   The 1040 Form  By April 15th of every year, you must submit your 1040 form and any owed taxes to the IRS. Your 1040 form is essentially a worksheet that you use to determine how much you owe in taxes for the year and how much more you still need to pay (or how much you are owed). If you are wondering why the IRS doesn’t do it for you, the reason is that there is no way for the IRS to know what deductible expenses you had over the year. For example, they’ll have no way of knowing if you had $1,000 in gambling losses.  On the surface, filling out a 1040 is not particularly difficult. You enter the information from your W2, perform the required addition\/subtraction, and compare what you paid in taxes over the year to what you actually need to pay.  The issue is that taxes can get really complicated for some. If you qualify for a credit, you’ll need to fill out the corresponding form. If you want to itemize deductions rather than take the standard deduction, you’ll need to fill out a form in which you do so. If you own a small business in which your personal and business taxes are intertwined, there is a lot that goes into figuring out your tax burden. There’s a reason tax accountants exist.   "
